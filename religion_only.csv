3,"so as the title suggests; I am 15f and my family is absolutely against Islam but I want to buy a hijab and underscarf to wear out in public whenever I can when I go out alone without family. And also to pray salah.
Only thing is I need the shop to be in a metro - accessible mall of some sort. Otherwise it’s impossible for me to buy it.

Please help sisters..and it shouldn’t be too costly as well as I’d have to put my own money towards this. I don’t want to buy anything expensive."

I’ve been thinking for awhile and I feel connected to Islam. I’m 13f and don’t have access to much at the moment. I live in the us so there aren’t mosques near me. Any tips for starting off?"

**Edit: There is some confusion in the comments, so I'm going to drop veganism for now, just to be safe for Islamic reasons and also because it isn't practical in my country and household. I also started finding faults in it, and was curious about the Islamic take on this ideology.** "
10,"I am a Muslim and always have been, I am also Iranian living in America, all I ever hear about Islam is extremely negative, about how terrible Iran is and how bad the religion and its followers are, at school and in media, any suggestions/help would be much appreciated, it’s tearing me apart."
11,"AsSalamu alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuh,

No matter the consequences I will tell the truth here. 

I gave my Shahada back in 2012, but I never believed in things like the flood of Nuh and the night Journey, and as I came out of Evangelical Christianity I brought a lot of hangups about religion being about belief, not rituals, and society being about separation between religion and state. 

I didn't pray, and I never learned a single sentence in Arabic. 

I was basically a half-converted heretic, and I accept that.

I left, as my direct family is Christian and full of American veterans, my father, for example, far in the past, considered all Muslims terrorists. He literally asked me if I had joined a terror cell when I first reverted. 

I have no excuse for my actions and former beliefs. Even if I can't be accepted back I will still practice Islam properly now, a loner for the rest of my days. 

This is the only perfect religion, and Shariah the best way to govern a society

I'm learning how to pray, I plan on learning Arabic, I even got Rosetta Stone for proper understanding of the Qur'an and ahadith. I've stopped eating pork, I stopped drinking, I don't eat blood, I don't gamble, I don't listen to music other than nasheeds and I respect and love my parents and my brother. My memories of Hamza Yusuf and Ahmed Deedat videos and remembering that I once read a  Al-Baqarah helped me enormously.

Would i be able to go to Jannah? Even if I'm charred beyond recognition, the last one to enter Jannah, I will be comforted."
12," Hello all! 


I recently started looking into Islam about 2 weeks ago. I was acquainted with Islam for a while though, through friends and just daily dealings.

I have had issues with Christianity for a few years now and just recently started to take my journey seriously. I figured Islam would be a good place to start because I knew I believed in an abrahamic God, so why not look at Islam. 

I brought this up to my gf of 2.5 years against my better judgment, because Christians practicing or not make it a huge deal.  At first she said she was really happy for me that I was taking this journey etc etc. 

I felt so relieved, until yesterday when I mentioned I had been reading the Quran. She got very upset that I was “studying” the religion, and said she thought it was a passing thought and I should start going to church again and study Christianity only for my questions. Long story short with some tears welling in her eyes I asked her “would you leave me if I converted?” She paused and said “maybe, probably”. Due to the fact our children would be raised Muslim and a big factor of dating me was that I was Christian. 

She is not practicing Christianity actively(nor does she attend church) , and expressed questions herself so it really caught me off guard and made me feel as though I was given an ultimatum of my soul or her. I am no where near a conversion, I told her this as well. I followed Christianity blindly for decades, I won’t do the same again and plan to study the Quran for at least a year. That seemed to make her feel better for now, but I feel a strong pull to Islam and feel at peace reading the Quran. I’m going to my first Friday prayer tomorrow and really am just looking for some support, or if someone else has been through this to share what helped them.


Sorry if I rambled this whole thing has made me really upset. Thank you all in advance, I also don’t think she realized how much her saying that hurt me."
13,"i am not an convert, but always had some interest in islam, these few weeks it has become stronger again and i have been reading alot and listening alot about islam. today i prayed to Allah for the first time ever, and while i was praying i started crying and i cant stop crying ever since, the first time during prayer was a cry of relief but now it feels like im hurting and completely lost. i know its probably hard to say what this means but i could really use an listening ear."
14,"I find it quite interesting that many of the Founding Fathers of America rejected the idea of the Trinity.

Thomas Jefferson wrote his own Bible and dismissed the Christian concept of the Trinity. He also called Paul “a corrupter of Jesus’ teachings”.

John Adams is quoted to have proclaimed, “the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity”.

His wife, Abigail Adams, said “I acknowledge myself a unitarian - Believing that the Father alone, is the supreme God, and that Jesus Christ derived his Being, and all his powers and honors from the Father. ... There is not any reasoning which can convince me, contrary to my senses, that three is one, and one three”.

Famous non-Muslim figures from all across history (ex. Issac Newton) have rejected the notion of the Trinity. 

It is interesting to see that these “Christians” held almost Muslim beliefs, despite Islam not reaching a lot of them.

It shows that any logical Christian will come to the conclusion that Jesus was a prophet and not divine, and God is one. The concept of three as one and one as three doesn’t appeal to the human mind and goes against logic and common sense (as Abigail Adams said).

Just found that pretty intriguing."

A bit nervous 
But overall very VERY grateful for these AMAZING people on Reddit and Discord!! Thank you all so much! I’ll be forever grateful!"

Don’t forget to recite Surah al kahf on Friday! Abu Sa’id al-Khudri reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Whoever recites Surat al-Kahf on Friday will have a light between this Friday and the next.” ‎عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ فِي يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّورِ مَا بَيْنَ الْجُمُعَتَين Source: al-Sunan al-Kubrá 5856"
18,"I am a 15-year-old boy from the U.S. and I've reached kind of a stalemate in religion. I converted to Orthodox Christianity in 2020, researched Islam vs. Christianity all through the summer, and now I've reached this point. What logically makes sense to me? Christianity to be honest. I was raised Christian, became more Christian after I became Orthodox, and after all my research I still believe in Christianity because to me it still seems the most rational. But there is still something in my heart, that pulls me towards Islam. Now the Christian justification for this is because the heart and deceitful and wicked which I do believe, but still, the feeling that there is a stalemate still remains. I'm probably going to continue being Orthodox Christian because I believe in christianity and have certain objections to the Muslim narrative. I posted this to the Christian Reddit as well for reference."
19,"I gave my salams , and was almost finished reciting ayatul Kursi before getting up and accidentally farted. Is the prayer invalid?"
20,"I want to listen to reciters that make me feel the Quran. For example, they change their voice/tone more harsh when Allah is commanding, when Allah is speaking about jannah its more softer. I like Noreen Muhammad I love how he changes his tones. I want to feel, I want to cry, I want to focus. Please any recommendations!"
21,"Let me first say that I’m an Indian American with Hindu parents, so I don’t really have any authority on this topic.

Anyway, I’m wondering : is there such a thing such as “pan Islamic” identity? I kinda get the feeling that Muslims from around the world, regardless of nationality, feel like they are part of this “club”. 

Let me give you an example: my sister is married to a Bangladeshi Muslim, and his brother in law is an Indian Muslim. He went to Umrah, also other places in the Middle East and came back. He was telling his daughter how “infrastructure and architecture in America is so bad, ‘our’ architecture is so far ahead, you should go to the Middle East when you grow up.”

He’s not the only one, but I’ve heard a lot of south Asian Muslims (Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Indians) refer to middle eastern culture and countries as “ours”.  However, I’ve never seen middle eastern Muslims say that about, say, Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country. 

I wonder if my experience is very specific or this is a general trend. Also wondering what contributes to it, I only see this with Jews and Muslims (having an identity that regardless of nationality goes back to a certain region), not with Christians or Buddhists or Hindus (well Hindus are really only majorities in two countries so doesn’t count I guess)."
22,Salam. I Hope your are all Good. I Want to Marry a Girl and i really love her she is a also a muslim. I Often Make dua that she gets feelings for me and we get married  but so far my dua has not been accepted yet unfortunately can someone please give me tips or help me may Allah bless you and reward you abundantly
23,"Love can also be negative and will have harmful affects sometimes like when you lose a loved one or someone you loved betrayed you. You will become depressed and will be in an unstable state. Whereas if you prioritise Allah you will never be in a dreadful situaton. Love is also temporary, it might not be permanent which can be seen in some marriages. People should marry for the sake of Allah and not because of their love interests. Both the parties should look at the islamic qualities they possess rather than their looks and education.

there is also another type of love like sibling love and parental love but yet again you should prioritise Allah because if you love your parents or siblings more than Allah you will be an easier prey for shaytaan. Every living being is mortal while Allah is immortal. Love is temporary but Allah isn't."
24,"Assalamualaykum, I know there are 7/13 (?) Reading style of the Quran, can anyone tell me what kind of reading this young boy is using? And where can I learn? i think it is more easy on the tounge, so far i can only read the reading style that is popular, the one that is used in makkah. Jazakumullahu khairan

25,"I love Islam and want to be a good Muslim but i struggle a lot to be a good muslim. I keep trying but feel it’s pointless. I no longer have the urge to pray because I feel just so sad and low but my heart really wants to and I want to. 

I want to do better and be better in every way. I stayed to wear the hijab but now I feel worse because I feel I’m putting the hijab to shame or something like that even though I believe wearing a hijab does not make u Muslim. Please can I have some tips on how to slowly build my faith up and be better rather than doing this and that all at once overnight."
26,"Salam. I am really depressed because I have a bad job, I am getting older with no family of my own. I feel so depressed in life that I sometimes feel suicidal. I don't know why my life is so hard and stressful. I am also really struggling with my iman. I feel everyone would be better off without me. I just ended a friendship with my only friend. I just so sick of being here in this life. I feel like everybody has everything they want in life but me 
 I just feel lost in life"
27,"I was having a conversation with my uncle, and he said that he doesn’t judge or hate any religions except for “Muslim”. Which instantly triggered me, because I am still working on my conversion. He said the reason why he doesn’t agree with it, is because he said in the Quran, it says “Try to convert others, or kill them.” I just don’t know how much I believe that. I could be wrong though, any advice or answers will be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

30,"I chose to be homeschooled for my IGSCE course and I feel like I missed a lot of oppurtunities this year if I had went to public school.  


Because of this, I've repeatly regretted my decision, and became anxious how my decision to be homeschooled is going to affect my educational future to the point where it's deteoriating my mental health. I even started feeling slightly jealous of my younger sister, who has a bright future in her education. I feel demotivated to even study since to me, its hopeless. But I want to get better and have faith in Allah's plan for me. What should I do to tackle all of this?"
31,"I'm not a hadith rejector at all I'm just looking for some more clarifcation. As I understand it hadiths were collected roughly 200 years after the death of our prophet pbuh. I just want to know more about the in between.

From what I understand hadiths were collected during the life of the prophet and immediatley after. Which spawned several books of hadith. Bukhari and Muslim combed through the already established hadith and filtered out all the weak ones and gave them their grade.

Am I correct in this understanding? Or did the hadith scholars physically travel around arabia and collected the hadiths themselves?"
32,"Me and my wife are talking about her getting a septum piercing and belly button piecing. The intention is to only do it for each other as she is a fully cloaked woman. She wears full covering except she shows the face.

33,"I have always been agnostic never been forced to follow a religon or belief. But i have always thought islam is the most beautiful religion. I was at work today and my Mate came up to me talking about just everything thats going on in the world and asked me for my views which i had shared with him. After he had asked me about my religious views and i had told him my views on islam he had asked me if i would like to go to a mosque with him. If i can be honest i was the happiest i have ever felt in a long time. Which he said think about it and read about islam a little bit and get back to me . Wich i have just spent about 2/3 hours reading about Shahada, Salat, Zakat, Sawm, Hajj . Which i thought to my self this just sounds amazing and something i would seriously like to consider.  I was just wandering would i be welcomed to a mosque as a non muslim at this time or would it be best to wait ?"
34,Salam alaikum brothers and sisters. I wanted to ask you all to pray for everyone who has a dear in distress. My friend had an accident. And is in coma. I wanted to ask for some Duas not only for him but all those in hospitals. Please pray for my dear friends and loved ones. And please spend more time with your beloved ones before Allah SWT takes them to himself. Was Salam alaikum. Was Rahman Allah barakatu..
35,"Assalamualaikum, I've finally converted after two years of contemplation! So far, I've prayed five times and have been on time for all. Today, I had to pray Maghrib five minutes early as I had somewhere else to be, so I consequently missed Isha—I read somewhere that if I miss Isha for any valid reasoning, I can still pray it before midnight. Is this true?

Unrelated, but thank you for all the replies on the previous questions I've made. They were extremely insightful & thoroughly appreciated."
36,"السلام عليكم, I'm a revert from Madrid. I've been trying to find Muslim clothing like a qamis, or thawb in this city, but all the stores I find are either not Muslim (just Arab clothes that don't cover arwah) or for women. I can't manage to find any physical store where they sell clothes for men.

I would really like to have one of these because of how practical they are. Qamis or thawb is comfortable, is modest and not tight, and unlike pants, my back won't be revealed during sujood, which happens too often and I hate it.

Could anyone tell me where do they sell these? Thank you."
37,Salam. I have a small question which has been stressing me out. I spend a good 10 minutes removing my mascara /eyeliner (not waterproof) making sure it’s completely gone before performing wudhu although at the end of the day I will take a tissue and wipe my eyes and see a small black Speck smaller than a mm appear on the tissue. This makes me question if any of my previous salahs that day were valid or not since idk if that small speck of mascara or eyeliner invalidated my wudhu. Please advice me . Thankyou
38,"Mashallah brothers and sister I saw a video where the car plays a dua-e-safar when you start the car. Comments on that video say it is normal in Saudi and other muslim country for car to have this. Where in the US can I buy this? I find a couple on ebay but shipping is ridiculous since it ships from UK and it needs cigarette lighter which my vehicle does not have (I can wire to fuse box no problem). I've been in two car accidents in the past year, would like this a lot for protection and prayer and peace of mind. Thank you!"
39,"I was told several ayahs and hadiths about divorce being bad, a last resort, etc. and I've also come across sheikhs and others (from the West) talking about divorce casually with one saying it's mubah. I would initially assume it's makruh but as a revert, I could be very wrong. In practice, not just theory, how is divorce seen as? Is a divorced woman or man seen any differently? I'm speaking primarily about in the West."
40,"In this time span Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha will be included. I really don't want to miss any."
41,"In the us and girl in my class  talked to me few times for class stuff nothing flirty or anything. But we see each other twice a week.

Similar age and from same countries.


My situation is that I m the man of the house and make 1000$ a week to support my family and basically paycheck to paycheck while going to school.


I really want to get to know her more and talk to her family. 


She never talks to me first i always have to start something that has to be class related, she does not talk to any men in class. 


How can I approach this knowning my situation?"
42,"When a Muslim starts stressing over his future, most of the times, people will tell him to trust in Allah's plan and everything will go well but Allah's plan can mean a lot of things: if someone ends up with a big job and becomes rich, alhamdullilah, that was Allah's plan. But if someone loses his job, becomes poor and lives in the streets for decades, astaghfirullah, that's also Allah's plan. So is it Islamically correct to tell a stressed Muslim to trust Allah's plan despite the fact that no one knows His plan?"
43,"Assalamalikum

I understand that life is a test and I will go through hardships till I die.

But surely I will experience happiness and success in this world at some points right?

I'm worried that I may not since I haven't had that point in life where I'm happy (except as a child). Obviously there's a reason why I'm depressed and it's because of constant never ending hardships and just no success.

Even though I pray 5 times a day, fast, give zakat.

I just know I would do so much more good deeds and less sins if I were happy. I feel like I'm wasting my life.

Allah says in the Quran that he’d respond, help is near, make a way out, give the believers are good life, with hardship comes ease.

But I just haven’t got the luxury of experiencing this yet for years.

It's not even about hope anymore. I just want to know and be reassured that I will have the 'highs' in my life.

So will I?"
44,"
I am exhausted. I have been waiting and waiting for a long time for the “one day everything will be alright” day. Waking up everyday that everything will be solved and I will get the “good news”. I pray or try to pray all 5 times, made my relationship halal got rid of haraam things in my life. It is hard sometimes to get motivation to pray on time and to keep hopes up. I tell myself atleast I have a roof on my head and food and one person who cares about me. I could have been in a much worse situation but here i am i say.

But the truth is it doesn’t trully comfort me. Because I want to be happy, I want to have hope. I am so afraid that if i miss a prayer i will be punished

We all have hardships and I see people around me go through and they get out of it, they get their good news and happily ever after. 
But for me itseems like i keep getting obstacles, I have severe depression, anxiety and thoughts of ending it all, but i am afraid. Afraid of punishment. Afraid i will never feel at peace ever. 
 
I am and was not ever prepared to be thrown in such a struggle for life. Maybe i am that I didn’t give up. I am so afraid that Allah will punish me if i do the slightest thing wrong. Sometimes it feels pointless, sometimes I say it will become better. But it feels like it will never, I am losing hope faster than ever."
45,"So because I have istihaadah, I need to perform Fardh salah immediately after I perform wudhu ( I was informed by my previous scholars)  but I noticed that reciting Quraan BEFORE I perform salah actually increases my concentration and calms me down. Is there a way that I can do to this without invalidating my wudhu?"
46,"3 questions.

Question 1: I have been struggling internally with drawing a line in which things are haram. With fitna I can't figure out my intention with putting on makeup, using concealer or bronzer, wanting my face to look lifted, eyelash extensions, putting on chapstick, brushing threw my eyebrows, curling my eyelashes, or even with nice shoes; in my head I am not doing it to get attention from men, I truly just want to look more presentable, my family is fine with this, but more importantly what does Allah (SWT) think.

Question 2: With repenting, I want to repent but while repenting in my head I'm not fully fully confident that I will never do it again; But wallah I truly want Allah to guide me. I feel immense guilt for things but I still want to feel more guilty.

Question 3: If I truly forget a sin I do, not knowing my intention, or even not know if what I am doing is a sin, will I still go to hell, even if it's only for a certain number or years? and if so how do I protect myself from even stepping a foot in hell.


Sorry for the bad punctuation!"

49,"İ have just started college and i am studying American culture and literature but for our class we need to go to where the western literary culture started, so my teacher gave us an homework to read the king James's bible (old testament). İ need to read genesis and exodus from it but i really don't want to. It feels like a bad thing to do for me, since i haven't finished quran(i am half way there)and i wanna learn more about quran and my religion instead of this but if i don't i'll bomb at the exams. What should i do?"
50,"I honestly have no other explanation towards what happened to me a year ago but despite me disliking God as a once agnostic... Allah i believe didn't want me on that path and im grateful.

I was a person full of sins and hatred and I never looked at it in that perspective. I always found myself to be the victim until one day in January my mind was opened and I realised how I wronged people and hurt them. In a dissociative state I was able to remember and recognise my past sins.

I realised how much allah has protected me and how much he wanted me to repent.

I believe truly that he opened a new perspective for me to repent and ask forgiveness. I cried and I cried and thankfully allah knows that despite the evil inside of me and my evil capabilities.. I chose to be kind instead.

If allah loves someone then he'd probably ask all his people to repent.

I am thankful that despite the error of my ways that I was shown the truth. Allah was looking at me in January and I was tested. I grew my strength for allah in a sick minded state and had my tragic event never happened I would have never gone back to allah. I love allah and I hope he can guide all of you in remembering your sins to repent before it's too late."
51,Haven’t read the Quran for years and getting back into it. What is this letter and how to pronounce it? Can’t find it on google Arabic alphabets.
54,"Firstly, all but one of my close friends are devoutly Catholic (the really traditionalist Latin Mass attending kind, not the kumbaya ecumenical type); as such I’m really worried about losing all my friends and social connexions as most of them view Islam as even worse than atheism.


Secondly, and this one is a little silly I feel, I have a number of icons and crosses that I’ve inherited from family members that it would break my heart to throw away. For one thing, some of them have been in my family for several generations and so I don’t real feel as though their really mine to throw away to begin with. Secondly, I have a number of things (in particular a gold cross) that were given to me by loved ones so to get rid of them would feel like I’m giving those people, whom I love dearly the middle finger. As to idolatrous objects I’ve bought myself, I have no problem getting rid of them. I’m not attached to any of these objects for religious reasons; purely for emotional reasons related to family.


Lastly, I’m confused as to the teaching around photography and trousers. As to photography, I’ve heard some say that it’s haram and I’ve heard others say that it’s halal because photos are effectively like a mirror due to having been made using light. I’d be fine never taking photos again but for sentimental reasons do have a big issue with getting rid of old photos, particularly those that include friends and family.


The teachings around trousers aren’t an issue standing in the way of my conversion but I did nonetheless want to clarify them. I’ve heard some say that under no circumstances can trousers go below the ankles and I’ve heard others say that it’s fine for them to do so as the teaching that garments should not go below the ankles originated in a very specific cultural context where long robes were a sign of immense wealth and luxury and that, especially since ankle length trousers in the west have historically been a lower class garment(with knee length breeches being worn historically by the nobility)it’s fine for them to fall below the ankles."

Alhamdulillah I am in a point in my life where I have a job with good pay, and It has been a goal of mine for a while to give charity.  
  
The mosque I go to is the only one I really go to consistently. So many times I have gone to pray and then read for a couple hours, whether it be Quran or Hadiths. It truly is my second home.

It's a temporary program for now and I hope I didn't put myself out of consideration because other than that I feel the interview went awesome.

I was wondering as a younger muslim girl, what parts of my figure can I show. I am not counting skin (all skin must be covered) I know that, but for legs. Is a little over the knee in leggings with a baggy Hoodie or a baggy dress, can the figure of my legs show? Or is it mandatory to wear either baggy pants (which is absolutely fine if so) or a baggy maxi skirt.

I apologize if I worded that wrong, I can clarify is so."

A friend of mine wants to revert to islam, i am a revert too and another friend who is born muslim and I try to help the non muslim boy. But he wants to know everything which is good, but he asked us why are we created. I do not find an answer that really answers this question.

It is not that i doubt islam but i really want an answer. For what reason did Allah create us? Do we do something special for Allah? But Allah does not need us, we need him so i do not understand. And for the people telling me that we chose this life instead of being an angel, why did Allah create the angels and give us the choice of living this life."
70,"I'm in university and in the morning while walking to class on campus I want to make a habit of reciting Duas asking for a good day, for Allah SWT to take care of all my affairs, protection from the evils and laziness, etc, but most of them I don't have memorized. 

There's a really good app called Dhikr & Dua which has Duas for all situations, but looking at my phone and reading them while walking and crossing roads doesn't seem safe and is hard to do. 

That's why I started listening to recitations of them because the app has that feature as well with my earbuds in so I can watch where I'm going.

But I was wondering whether the reward won't be the same and whether just listening to the recitations won't give me the same benefits I'm asking Allah SWT for compared to reading/reciting them myself will.

Can any Imams or Sheikhs tell me how it works, JazakAllah"

72,"I explain you my situation please read me and make dua for my family.

I became Muslim some months ago, and since then I also expressed my faith to my sister and she eventually also became Muslim Alhamdulillah. 

We kept it in secret from my family, because we know they don’t like it, but ofc since then our way of acting and dressing has changed. Anyway, they did not thought it was a religious thing. My parents believe in the Bible, in God, Jesus as the son of god, and in the Holy Spirit, but they don’t really practice a lot. 

Now they know we are Muslim, they found out some days ago (less than a week)

I live in Spain, and my family somehow believe most Muslim are Moroccan, so they are really ashamed of us now, here in Spain there is a lot of racism against Moroccan people and Muslims in general, so everyone is also telling them that their daughters becoming Muslim is the worst.

The problem is that I don’t know how to help my parents. They are destroyed since they know, specially my mom, she does not eat, talk, or sleep, she does not even walk straight, my dad told me she was crying at work also, and that she said she does not want to live anymore. My dad was also crying. They told me that for them is like we died.

They told both me and my sister to leave the house next month, they don’t want to live with us anymore. 

They believe because of this we are not their daughters anymore, they say they are ashamed of the way we dress, and that we are in the wrong path. They say Moroccan are shit and now we look like one of them. 

I spoke to them about Islam, I tried to make them calm down, but my mom looks like dying. How do I help her????? 

Please make dua for my parents. May Allah soften their hearts and help them accept it. My moms is called Carmen, my dad Alejandro. It kills me seeing them like this, please help. Help please I am scared my mom does something stupid. Help please. My said she is all the time thinking about it please help. 😞"
74,"[96:16](https://quran.com/96/16), refers to the forelock  of Abu Jahl referring to it as ""a lying sinful forelock"". A lot of muslim scholars claim that this proves a scientific fact which claims that the front part of the brain is responsible for decision making and thus lying. I understand the science behind it, but I don't understand, how muslims scholars join the word forelock with the inner part of the brain cause they are different thigns? Can someone explain to me? Is it just because the forelock is propotional to that side of the brain, but that does not make sense to me, or is it because the english word forelock isn't enough to explain the arabic word, that is used in the Quran?"
75,"How are verses such as: كهيعص , يس , ن ، طسم

77,"Assalamualaikum 

I know I have the knowledge to call people to Islam and how to respond to certain things atheists say, but for some reason, this knowledge goes to waste when I discuss with my atheist friends. They say certain things, and then I start panicking, my heart rate rises, I get angry, and end up not even being able to properly give dawah.

This usually happens when I discuss with two certain people who always gang up on me, ask me questions in an interrogative manner, and ask questions like why did Allah create gay people and then prohibit homosexuality. And I know I can answer that question but my knowledge disappears whenever I am asked these kind of things.

When someone asks me about Islam politely and sincerely I am always able to answer their questions well.

How do I overcome this problem and be able to speak eloquently and calmly similar to da’ees like TheMuslimLantern?"

79,"Hi. I'm a teenage girl from the United States. For all my life, I have been agnostic. My parents never made me go to church, they never forced me to follow a doctrine, they have never forced me to pray. Recently, I've gone down a rabbit hole of Muslim street preachers on YouTube. Something about it has really struck a chord with me. I feel something inside when they talk about Islam. In my history class, we begun talking about Islam as a world religion. For one of my projects, I had to read some of the Qur'an. Something about that felt so special to me. I've listened to people recite the Qur'an in Arabic. I don't understand Arabic, but I still felt something. 

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do with all of this. Both of my parents are agnostic. I don't know any Muslims. I would really like some help. Thank you all. "
80,"Hi, I am a pretty privileged guy but I don’t want to expose who or where I am so just called me potato, I am a 19yr old male, so my father’s side of the family are heavily toxic and all my childhood was constantly fights and argument and on top of that my father developed an ego from his success so because of it I get fights with my father too, I never cussed him out or anything but I just get annoyed by the fact that he uses his family against me. I am the black sheep because I like nerdy stuff and that caused my father to think I’m weak so he forcefully made me go to the gym and forcefully pray. Here is where his family come into the picture. They are filled with ‘hype people’ that supports what my father does even if he is in the wrong.my father caused a lot of pain and suffering and their answer is to back bite me. Then with all of this happening my mother wants to divorce my father but my father just cusses out my mother and berating her. I don’t like them because they have been a negative attitude towards me and my mother. I have siblings but they haven’t told me if they had issues with this. But I want to cut off my father’s family side from my contacts and my father is included. Is it haram or not? I don’t want to suffer any longer."

82,Where can I find the most accurate quran in English? Send Amazon link or eBay please thank you.
83,"Salam. I am a Muslim and I’m typing this while I cry. One thing I never really understood is , why is there so much pain in this life? And yes I am aware Allah is not cruel. I am also aware Allah doesn’t burden a soul beyond that it could bear. And no I’m not talking about pain that we humans inflict upon our selves (such as doing haram and then ending up being hurt) but rather the pain that’s caused by things that are not in our control. I am talking about poverty, illness, disabilities, death etc. These are things that are only in Allah’s control. Why does Allah make some people go through these while others are living their lives comfortably? Why is this world so unfair? Astaghfirullah I don’t mean anything wrong. But these are just my thoughts. My heart breaks and hurts for people going though terrible situations that are not in their hands."
84,"I want to share that I'm on a journey to get closer to Allah. For a long time, I had been avoiding the Muslim religion, but after a night of reading and researching, I suddenly felt a profound sense of peace. As someone who was once an atheist, searching for meaning, I now believe I've found my calling within this faith. Everything finally seems to make sense. However, my concept of God is still somewhat distorted, and I'd appreciate any information about Allah that you can provide, but not too overwhelming. I'm sure about my desire to embrace this religion now, but I do have some fears about certain knowledge that I may not be ready for. Thank you all so much for your support on this journey."
85,"And i can’t move out.

What should i do ?"
86,"This question has been in my head for a month or so. I really didn't have anyone to ask and i remembered reddit existed. I am 17 and from a muslim family. 
In surah al-an'am, verse 8, Allah says:

""They say, “Why has no ˹visible˺ angel come with him?” Had We sent down an angel, the matter would have certainly been settled ˹at once˺,1 and they would have never been given more time ˹to repent˺.""

 When he says ""the matter would have been settled at once"" does he mean there couldnt be proof of islam is the true religion or else there won't be an exam? If he does, why should i continue to believe a religion with no proof that its true?

 I always thought people who said ""It's about faith not reason"" were people who didnt know much and that opinion was wrong. But since i saw this ayah, im really questioning my religion. 

This is not a hate post to the religion. I'm completely sincere and i actually need help to understand this topic better."
87,"I really just need any words of support or any knowledge that anyone can bestow upon me. 

Like the title says, I was born female. I was raised in a non-practicing white Catholic family. My uncle (through marriage) is Muslim. I had always felt drawn to Islam because of him, but the rest of my family is very prejudice against Muslims. I felt too scared to ask him anything as a kid in fear of my family. 

As a teen, my little brother died and I was very lost. I have a medical condition (PCOS) which causes me to grow excess facial hair as a woman. It also affects my voice and I experience a little bit of thinning near the crown of my hairline (my paternal aunt experienced this as well). Because of this and seeing transgender people online, I had thought that somehow it meant I was supposed to be a man.

Now that I see the truth and that this was all a test as I finally found my way to Allah(SWT) and Islam, I knew right away I must detransition. I never thought I could have been such a fool to make such a grave mistake.  Luckily, I had not had any surgeries done, but I did take testosterone for a year or so. 

My greatest worries now, aside from striving to be a good Muslim girl, are wondering if people will judge my journey negatively. I don’t plan on announcing all of this to people in real life. That’s why I’m saying it here because those sins are in the past. However, I’m even more embarrassed to have people hear my voice or see my face if I’m just wearing a hijab versus a niqab. I’m afraid others might think I’m a man trying to pretend to be a Muslim girl, when really I was born a natural woman.

I’m scared I’ll never be wanted for marriage or that I’ll be ostracized from the community. I’m not sure how situations like mine are taken or even just being a woman with PCOS in general."
88,"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته،

I am asking Allāh for something that seems very impossible to me but Allāh is Al Qadeer (The Powerful and The Fully Able One), He is Al Fattah (The Opener), He is Ar Rahman (The Extremely Merciful), He is Ar Raheem (The Bestower of Mercy) and Al Mujeeb (The One Who Responds). 

And nothing is impossible for Allāh. So, I humbly ask you all to pray that Allāh accepts my duās with lots of blessings.

اللهم صل على محمد وعلى ال محمد كما صليت على ابراهيم وعلى ال ابراهيم انك حميد مجيد اللهم بارك على محمد وعلى ال محمد كما باركت على ابراهيم وعلى ال ابراهيم انك حميد مجيد.

May Allāh accept my heartfelt duās with lots of blessings, امين.

89,"Salam everyone. I am a woman in my 20s, I’ve had this issue for a long time. Anytime I see something about someone trying to “disprove” Islam I get scary thoughts or when I am learning about Islam I get more bad thoughts. The thing is, is it wrong for me to ask a sincere question to fix this confusion? Or is me asking a question kufr?

For example I saw something about the back bone and rib cage. And I was honestly just confused. I had this scary sick feeling in my chest. I basically feel like “I’m Muslim I wanna be muslim there is an explanation and even if I don’t understand the explanation, I still wanna be Muslim” and I think “there are so many Muslims and scholars and there is a reason why they stick to Islam”


I mean there are so many things in Islam I don’t understand, but I accept. For example, i understand men are more logical and less likely to divorce. But I don’t understand why only men get the power by just saying divorce. But ! I still believe in Islam and accept it. I mean if I just constantly looked for an explanation for every single thing, it’s just pointless because we as humans can’t always understand certain things.

Anyways at the same time I still ask questions to learn more , not as a way to “challenge” or “disprove” Islam, but rather to prove Islam is the truth and learn more. However I get this horrible feeling when I don’t understand something. Or certain things that  I still don’t understand, I get bad thoughts.  I was sitting in my car watching videos trying to understand the verse, and the I was just thinking “oh my god, what if I just die right now? Am I a kafir?”

Here are my questions. If I want to believe in Islam, I want to be Muslim, I want to be certain, do these thoughts affect my faith? Do any questions I ask because of these thoughts affect my faith? I have this major fear of kufr. I NEVER want to leave islam. I have no intention of leaving. I make dua to Allah to let me die as a Muslim. But I am so terrified. What if my pre destination im not Muslim? I want to be Muslim. What do I do? Am I a Muslim? I am not a good Muslim but I still care and try my very best to pray all 5 prayers and avoid sins and fast. I think about death everyday I can never live in without Islam knowing I can die at any second and wallah I have no idea how these atheists do it astughfirallah

I just need some peace. I feel sick. I wanna learn more and more about Islam without worrying about this thought and that thought and being confused and worrying if I am a kafir or not. Ya Allah, I just wanna be a good Muslim and live in peace. Any advice? Am I a muslim?

 I know some people may say I worry too much, but can you blame me? I mean dying as a kafir is eternal hell fire. I actually cannot move on with my day thinking I might be a kafir and can die any second and be in hell forever. I don’t wanna take any chances which is why I constantly worry if I did kufr. However, I heard that these thoughts may be from shaytan to try and lure me away from Islam. I mean, how come I may get these and thoughts when reading Quran? Is it shaytan? 

I don’t know what to do. Any one just please help I would appreciate it. And PLEASE make dua for me. I am genuinely asking if you guys can make dua for me to become a better Muslim and die as a Muslim.  Jazakallah khair"
90,My grandmother is dying. She’s probably only got a day or two to live. I was just told when I woke up this morning. She’s not Muslim and it breaks my heart that I can’t make dua for her (I’m a revert my family is Christian). I don’t know how to think. I’m planning on booking an appointment with my therapist.
91,"Hi, I'm doing some research about islam, and I was wondering if there is anything similar to what catechism is for christians.

92,"Salam wa Alaikum wa Rahmatullah. 

‏بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم

My older brother (24) and I (22) have always had a relatively good relationship. However, from the time he started university and in the years leading up to it, he’s become unrecognizable. He engages in every sin imaginable to it’s furthest degree. I don’t want to post anything that could break my anonymity, but a parent of ours in currently undergoing treatment for cancer, and is in need of support. I basically had to beg for him to come home to be with the family and leave the overseas degeneracy.  He eventually agreed and came back, he’s covered in tattoos and is unashamed of the pain he’s causing our parents. He’s basically a hippy.  We are also in an incredibly Islamic nation, walking outside we get a lot of stares because if his appearance.

Anyway, I tried to maintain the relationship and make it clear that I don’t respect his actions but I have to fulfill my obligations as a brother. Now, while our parent is undergoing treatment, I am living with him. I try to explain Islamic concepts and make it easy, but it makes him uncomfortable, despite him claiming otherwise. He was telling me that he was intimate with all of his female friends and that it was love and that it was because they are comfortable around him, to which I explained that it was disguising, that they are destroying themselves and that he was taking advantage of them. He prys and attempts to make me expose my sins despite making it clear that I will not, to which he asserts that I am silly for believing in Islam. That I am not liberated and I should try out his lifestyle. I tell him that he’s disningenuos because he will look to Asian mystics and foreign hedonism in sex tourist nations, fornication, and nihilism instead of his own religion. He says he knows enough about Islam to leave it. That Islam is a waste of time. I know that both are clearly not true. I know that he’s as ignorant as someone who has never read a page of the Quran. I keep telling myself he’s in jahiliya and he has a period of repentance. I tell him that too. 

I told him that he was following his desires and he was proud of that. Saying that we’re animals and that it’s totally correct. I asked him if he would support me if I said I desired to murder. He said that he would. It’s clear that I can’t have a reasoned conversation with him. He either tries to cut me off use expletives and tell me to F off or turn it into a joke. He can’t be reasoned with and he’s living without guilt.

After he said that it was a waste of time I told him to take it back, that he insulted me. He said he didn’t, that if anything he insulted the religion. I told him that was worse and that I would never speak to him again unless he apologized. He basically did but not without attempting to place conditions, he is prideful, but I left the room so I’m unsure, this all happened after a hospital visit by the way.

I need guidance, how should I engage with him? Honestly being in front of him makes me feel sick, I am in disbelief as to his ability to behave so terribly and see nothing wrong with his way of life. His heart has been turned to stone.

Please, what do I do and how should I behave in front of him? My parents look past his issues. They are blinded by love. If I ever attempt to guide him they come to his defense despite being religious, I know now that I cannot outwardly disassociate with him in his incredibly sensitive time for my family for these coming few months.

I apologize for my incoherent typing as I’m incredibly upset."
93,"Thank you to many Muslim redditors here. It’s been far too long since I prayed, I finally decided to pray fajr today in the morning.

I felt so serene, so peaceful. It just felt..different. I’m so glad I could do this.
Honestly fajr is much easier for me to pray because I wake up VERY early due to school and my parents aren’t awake so it’s easy to hide it from them (parents are non Muslim and not really supporting).

For now, I plan be regular in fajr…then slowly add all the other salahs back. InShaAllah I’ll be able to do that.

I am very happy now, JazakAllah to those who helped, and pls make dua for me so that it becomes easier for me. Thank youuuuu"
94,I know that it’s best to sleep on your right side but honestly sleeping in that position for so long is causing my shoulder to hurt I can’t even sleep cuz of the pain 💀 And I’m aware that we should not sleep on our stomach or left side. But how about back?
95,I got so discouraged when I got my period today since praying is my main way of always remembering god and keeping my heart at peace. Thank god I see it as a break from the world and it makes me so much happier but idk how will I stay feeling this way after I got my period. My period is also super long(12-11 days usually ) so I need something that will keep me at peace until I can  pray again
96,I’m asking because I’m dealing with eating disorder and I binge eat from boredom and stress. It’s been really hard for me to deal with. I think if thinking that food is fuel and that I shouldn’t think about it as the most important thing in life it would be easier to stop thinking about eating all the time. I do love food but I have fear from it from all the talk I get from people that I’m skinny and all.. I’ve gained a bit of weight from all the sweet binge eat and I look so unhealthy and I cry each time after eating. I loved my body the way it was I ate healthy and took care of it but moving back to my country and being surrounded by ppl who only eat (unhealthy) and have nothing else to do but sit all day has made me mentally sick and depressed. I’m not even as skinny as they say I’m skinny fat. But what’s the problem of me wanted to lose more weight until I reach my body goal I want to be fit and healthy cuz that makes me feel better about myself. Am I wrong or what? I’m so lost I feel so lost and my confidence went downhill.. i need help
97,"When I see things like dua are more accepted when it’s raining or during tahajjud, what does that mean? Because Allah swt is all knowing so surely he accepts all duas, it’s just a matter of how he responds.

Edit: idk if this made sense, but when it says ‘accepted’ does it mean Allah swt hears us more during this time or we’re more likely to get what we want at this time?"

101,"Salam Aleukoum,

I’ve read that if someone misses a prayer because of sleep, it is a « valid » justification and therefore he just has to pray it when he wakes up. My question is, in which circumstances is this acceptable? If you put an alarm and don’t hear it? 

If you do not put an alarm on purpose and decide to just wake up naturally, is missing a prayer during that period of time would be considered a sin or would it be « acceptable »?

If you do not put an alarm on and know that you will not wake up for the prayer because you are too tired for example, I guess that it would be a sin right?

Thank you for you answers, I’m just trying to learn."
102,"I know the title seems stupid but i have a question. In Quran it is stated that Allah is the best planner it means that whatever is going in your life whether it is harsh or a happy life it is going according to Allah’s plan if and only if you wills to trust in his plan. But doesn’t trusting blindly in Allah confines me to a limited degree of freedom? If whatever i am doing is according to Allah’s plan then can i ask for an explanation? What if somewhere in my life there is a period of harsh moment where I’m supposed to learn from such moment (could be from my mistakes or from people in general) but i am unable to do it because such moment has blinded my mind to see the flaws and learn from them. Let’s say i do everything right, trust in Allah, do as many good deeds as possible yet i am still living a hard life. Can i ask for an explanation? Or maybe for a help to help me locate my flaws or mistake so i could learn from the said experience. Or do i just let go? Trust in him blindly, Let go of my freedom to choose and robs myself of the opportunity to learn from that moment. I am having a harsh moment lately and i have tried so hard to ask for his assistance but i feel like i am unable to connect. Maybe I’m not understanding his message, or maybe is it because I’m blinded due to shetan’s interference. Everyone tells me to just trust and wait but i want an explanation so i could learn and pass this advice to someone else in future. Thank you for your help."

And to the people of Midian ˹We sent˺ their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah, and hope for ˹the reward of˺ the Last Day. And do not go about spreading corruption in the land.”

But they rejected him, so an ˹overwhelming˺ earthquake struck them and they fell lifeless in their homes."
105,Is it fair?
106,There are so much hardships in my life for a long time(2-3 years). I'm becoming frustrated and depressed about my life day by day. I know there must be way to get out of all these problems but it seems like Allah (SWT) is trying to hold us back from reaching that point. All these time I've told myself to have patience. I always remember the story of prophet Yakub and Yusuf to grow my patience but It's just not helping anymore. Sometimes i feel like my whole life is gonna pass from living in

108,"Just a little confused about the wording on this Hadith, why is Friday said to be divided into 12 hours not 24 hours?

The Prophet (ﷺ) said: Friday is divided into twelve hours. Amongst them there is an hour in which a Muslim does not ask Allah for anything but He gives it to him. So seek it in the last hour after the afternoon prayer."
109,"I used to do a a lot of backbiting before I got more serious about my deen, and now I am very concerned about the severe punishment for backbiting, because when I looked online for how to repent from backbiting, it said you must specify who you backbit. The problem is I don’t remember. Also, the people I do remember backbiting either can no longer be reached or they will be very angry with me if I told them what I said. How do I repent? I am scared"

It's 8am now and the pain has been reduced by a lot and the size also is reduced by a lot. 

What I did is considered bidah ? If yes, then how to properly use Zamzam as ruqyah ? Please answer as my heart is uneasy because I feel like i did biddah.

113,"So ive been recently getting doubts in my salah that i farted, like not intentionally, i think it just comes out on its on, now after over thinking allot  i thought is that even possible? Like how can a proper fart come out on its on? At first i was like probably unintentional farts am sure its forgiven cuz its accidental, but now this, i just think it comes out on its on, now obviously theres no sound and i guess no smell too, never smelt anything its just me doubting, so now am researching does this kind of fart really exist that comes out on its on and has a smell or sound cuz the only farts that break wudu is if there's a smell or sound according to this hadith 

 Sahih al-Bukhari 137
Narrated `Abbad bin Tamim:

My uncle asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the prayer. Allah' Apostle replied: ""He should not leave his prayers unless he hears sound or smells something.""

So now am here kinda relieved maybe i was just stupid the whole time and theres no such thing like that, like seriously, how can a fart come out on its on with a smell or a sound? Why would Allah create a system like that when we have to pray 5 times a day? welp now am starting to think that kind of fart doesn't exist, Haven't seen anybody experiencing that unless they have a medical condition which i don't have."

i do want to make it clear though that i missed years of prayers on purpose knowing that it's not right, before i even came back to Islam.

120,"Assalam Walakium warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Hello r/islam it’s been a while!

Since https://reddit.com/r/islam/s/oedwnGiV42 this post.

(Picture above of my reversion)

I’ve met some of the most beautiful people who have welcoming me with open arms and have taught me Islam through the Quran and Sunnah and alhamdulilah and although my journey has just begun I have found myself in the company of some good people. Which brings me to my post tagged as seeking support. 

Along my journey I have been blessed enough to encounter some pious people. One such individual opened his heart and his home to me even though I was a revert with a troubled background as such his family have also now have made me their family. The kindness of this man knew no bounds as he taught me Islam from the Sunnah, I truly feel fortunate and thank Allah SWT for this incredible blessing. Unfortunately, this man has stage 5 kidney failure and is in hospital right now. He played such a pivotal role in my coming into Islam and embracing the Sunnah that I feel I owe him a lifetime of gratitude second only to Allah SWT. I don’t have many friends as most of them distance themselves from me after my reversion but I know I have my brothers and sisters in Islam. I am a flawed individual seeking the duas of my fellow Muslims for this man. I am asking from the bottom my heart for your duas for this man, for this man is better then me and has a heart of gold. Please help. Please lend him your duas. I love you all for the sake of Allah SWT 

Jazakallah khairn"
121,"Salam everyone, please no judgement. I’ve been having lots of problems from certain Muslims calling me horrible names because of the country I’m from. I was told that I’m a prostitute, a witch, that Allah swt doesn’t love me, that I deserve to die, that I’m Islam’s weakest soldier, that Allah swt loves them more than he loves me (just to name a few things). This escalated quickly and worsened when a terrible earthquake hit us and people started manipulating the Quran to prove that we deserve it and that it’s our fault. I’ve seen these people celebrating and making duas for our complete destruction. In a desperate attempt to save my deen, I completely detached myself from the ummah. I’ve never been happier and more secure in my faith. Now I can’t look at Muslims in a positive light anymore and I can’t think of any unity for the ummah. Is this considered haram? Am I forced to accept these people?"
122,"As salamualaikum. 

Born in a nuclear Muslim family where my parents have been the core of my life, now things are changing. I don’t know why I am having a sense that something is absent in my life. Even though my parents love me and care for me and so do I. Yet, I feel there are things that I need to explore. 

Pondering a lot over the context I have discovered that I need a partner in my life and I don’t know how do I do!

Never had any conversation about getting married with my parents and it’s kind of awkward for me to let them know that I want someone in my life now!

I want to choose someone in my life but I have rarely interacted with females outside of my family line. So I don’t know whom should I look for it’s very complex for me. 

I am 26 now and I earn enough to sustain myself, Alhamdulillah. Is this to early to think about these? 

Any advice for me?"
123,"Assalam Walekum Everyone, I am learning islam from last few months. I sometimes read quran and hadith also and listen to several muslim scholars as well to clear my doubt. Islam came into my life because of a girl i love. She taught me some really gooood habits and character building. I really like how well she is connected to her allah. Her family is also very religious and so kind to me. They help me to get a better understanding. She had many better options than and she still can have better option than me, But that's not how love works. We really wanted to be together. So, I start learning islam deeply, Understanding the core concept and overall view as well. But somewhere in my deep mind it is there that am i doing this because of a person? Because i don't want that i should do this for a person, I want to do this because i want to believe in this religion, I want this to come by my heart. I want it to be natural and sometimes i feel really confident and sometime lows. Since childhood i understand the concept of One God, And i believe in this. But not doing shirk strictly being in a non muslim family is a bit difficult for me, I think it's not that big deal, I can do some minor activities to be with everyone. And praying other than allah gives me alarm in my mind, But some other religious activities i do. Maybe slowly i will reach at some level. Anyways, Her family is worried because of their daughter's age and not to delay in marriage. And i am not ready with my heart, They are trying to wait. And i am also trying. Sometime i get fear of the society and family members, But i know once my heart says naturally that i accept islam, I can handle everything. But i have a pressure from her family side as well to accept as soon as possible. And i feel so much pressure and forced feeling to accept islam. But i want to accept it naturally by my heart. I did everything she asked for, i am trying everything. Sometime thought came that is it only about religion? Am i not a good human being to be loved? Religion is very personal thing in my opinion and it should be respected. Sometimes clearing my doubt leads me to watch some videos with examples of quran verse and hadith by ex-muslims. I got different views from that side also and sometimes i feel stuck and don't know what to do, whether to proceed or leave."

Im tired of having no one to wipe my tears away.

Im tired of doing all of this

Im tired of not having my duas answered over and over   

Im tired of the mental torture and this utter trauma I have to endure

Im tired of getting nothing in the end.

To forgive my ignorant word

128,"There was a question regarding our Lord Jesus, so I wanted to search for the verses in the Quran that mention our Lord Jesus to find answers.

I usually rely on specific Arabic websites for research.
But, I thought why not try asking artificial intelligence to answer this question to see if it can provide verses from the Quran regarding that question, to save time.

When I read the answer, I found that some of the words in the verses ( Bing AI provided ) did not belong in the order I memorize. So, I searched for the literal translation of all the verses AI mentioned.

The artificial intelligence was unable to gather verses related to the question. Instead, it collected verses from different chapters of the Quran and merged them + added words that are not present in the Quran and replaced them with original words, forming verses with a different meaning that are not in the Quran.

When I asked it about the source, it said it was from the quran.com website. I am sure that this error is not from the website but rather a result of the AI defect.

So, I just wanted to warn in case someone doesn’t know about it."

So basically my whole life my parents told me we were Muslim, as a child I didn't know what that meant and I just lived life regularly while sometimes people asking me if I belong to an religion and me saying I'm Muslim.

The only thing I knew was that I can't eat pig..
In middle school there were a lot more Muslims in my class and I of course befriended them.

When they asked me if I'm Muslim I said I was one.

I didn't know anything about Islam in that time and the only thing I did was pray with my cousins when I was at their house.

I kept saying wallah to things and it got back to me since I broke 2 oaths already
My family never raised me Muslim only my distant family showed me some things.

Recently I tried getting into Islam and im not really feeling a connection.

I'm being ridiculed by everyone I know and it's only getting worse, they tell me I have to fast because I swore out of anger and broke it

I have a lot of questions and don't really know anymore"

I'm not really often participant in social media but every time I scroll of go ckeck something, I see a post where people bash Islam and muslims. Recently I went over the worldnews sub and I saw a post about a girl being emprisonned for not wearing hijab correctly in Iran, and the comments were...awful. My mistake was to start arguing and explaining but I got downvoted like crazy. I didn't even read the responses just deleted my comment, and muted all notifications to ease me. 

I'm not even going to talk about the media and politicians openly saying Islam has to be changed and muslims must take a step back from their religion if they want to fit in this country.   
I know that I shouldn't let other people opinions attain me but I'm starting to feel really anxious especially about the future.

136,"My dear Christian and Muslim friends and brothers

Earlier in Israel, Jews would spit as they passed by Christians

Because Allah/Yahweh/however you call God, is the witness

Just so you know that they can NEVER destroy our religion, no matter how hard they try

Because we are stronger than them

If they think they can destroy us, let them

But they will fail in the end

137,"I was reading the rihla of Ibn Battuta and i had doubts about alcoholic beverages in Islam. When he was in Turkey, he said ""When I went out I made enquiry about it and they said 'It is nabidh \[a fermented drink\] which they make from dugi grain.' These people are Hanafis and nabidh is permissible according to their doctrine."" (Ibn Battuta)  

Alcohol is haram, but is there something different in the hanafi madhab where it is allowed? Is there a difference between nabidh and wine? All my research translates wine to nabidh (نبيذ) in Arabic. I didn't find any good answer about it.

Al salam alikm brothers and sisters.

Recently, I have stopped attending the mosque for Friday prayers due to concerns over hygiene. I noticed that some attendees, mainly laborers from nearby construction sites, exhibit poor hygiene practices like sneezing and coughing without covering their mouths, or cleaning their noses without tissues. Following my visits to the mosque, I usually fall ill, which then takes two to three days for recovery. This illness affects both my employment and my business operations.

To maintain my health, I have started performing my Friday prayers at home, which has helped in improving my wellbeing. However, this change has led to concerns over fulfilling my religious obligations, as attending the Friday prayer (Jumu'ah) at the mosque is a significant aspect of Islamic practice.

On Fridays, besides performing the obligatory prayers, I engage in Sunnah prayers and recite Surah Al-Kahf. My employment and business responsibilities do not afford me the luxury of recovering from illness every week, hence the change in my Friday prayer routine.

Given these circumstances, is it permissible for me to continue performing my Friday prayers at home without incurring sin ?"

I am a Muslim from Pakistan. I will make it brief and clear.

I just performed Umrah a month ago. I dont know what wrong i did or what happened, but my Emaan (faith) is getting weaker. I know Islam well and 16yrs old, but its like.. like my beliefs are resetted/ restore to initial stages. I dont understand why but whenever i hear a thing about Islam, i start to question it, which i never questioned before, like as if i am hearing it for the first time.(possibly devil)

Idk why its happening, maybe because i have started to think about things aside from how the society takes it.

Please give any tips and help me, i don't want to lose my faith even a little bit. I was a very faithful boy untill 2-3 weeks ago. I pray to Allah and read Quran and Dua that Allah may guide me. However, in a sense i feel like the questions may come to mind so my faith can be even stronger after getting answers, but still for now i think my faith is getting weak. Please help."

So I honesty don’t know how to properly word/ ask the questions I have but I will try my best.
So the past couple months I’ve been trying to learn more about Islam so I can revert. (Before I convert I want to know how to pray and wear the hijab and dress modestly) I already know a couple things as my mom’s side of the family is Muslim. But I was raised Christian. So i told my closest friend that I’ve been wanting to convert  a couple weeks back. So basically today she was in her religion class and sent me a short article about Islam that basically tells you the basics and told me how for her class they cover more than just Christianity and how she thought Islam was interesting but she didn’t agree with it. Her biggest concern was that Jesus was named just a prophet and wasn’t called the son of god that never bothered me tbh because to me the trinity had always confused me. It’s wrong to me how Jesus was supposed to be perfect and died for our sins but we continue to sin isn’t that disrespectful? Anyways the questions I had was is there a Holy Spirit in Islam and if so how does that work? How did you learn to pray salah? If you reverted from Christianity did you have trouble accepting Jesus as a prophet? I look forward to your answers💗💗"

I was wondering if anyone has any knowledge about this hadith?

\*\*Narrated by Ubaidullah bin Abdullah that Ibn Abbas said: ""When the ailment of the Prophet became worse, he said, 'Bring for me (writing) paper and I will write for you a statement after which you will not go astray.' But \`Umar said, 'The Prophet is seriously ill, and we have got Allah's Book with us and that is sufficient for us.' But the companions of the Prophet differed about this and there was a hue and cry. On that the Prophet said to them, 'Go away (and leave me alone). It is not right that you should quarrel in front of me."" Ibn \`Abbas came out saying, ""It was most unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing that statement for them because of their disagreement and noise.” (Sahih Bukhari Volume 1, Book 3 (Knowledge) Hadith 114)\*\*​

What was the statement that Prophet Mohammed (sawas) was going to write which would never leave us astray?"
153,"Assalamu alaikum

I've been speaking to someone online for marriage and we reached the point where we both want to pray istikhara to see whether to proceed. We're supposed to tell each other about our decision very  soon and I still don't have a clear sense about whether to take things further or not. He checks all my boxes in terms of religiosity, being kind and considerate, and a provider in a very traditional sense, which are all rare characteristics in my eyes especially together. The only thing is that at first sight from seeing his picture I am not attracted to him physically. But it's confusing because I am someone who cannot dissociate physical attraction from personality, so perhaps I would be drawn to him if I saw his personality in action. I don't want to end up regretting what may have been a blessed union in all respects if only I didn't end it too abruptly.

How do I approach this situation where I prayed istikhara to gain clarity yet I feel just as conflicted as I did before praying??"

Legally i have no real legal recourse to change custody arrangements. I won't go into details of how or what she has or is doing but our kids are obviously no longer her priority.

155,"I hear and read a lot of hadiths or social media posts, talking about Salatul Hajat and Tahajjud. Hajat is a prayer you do when you have a really big wish or desire you need Allah to fulfill, and Tahajjud is a prayer you do during midnight.

But I also read something along the line ""You can't say you've done everything you could for the thing you want until you've performed Tahajjud.""

Then there are a bunch of Muslims telling stories of their own lives, about how they all wanted something so badly, so they performed Tahajjud and then ""The dua was answered the same day"" and that ""A Tahajjud Dua is an arrow that never misses its mark,"" etc. etc.

I'm like, ""Wow, Tahajjud seems so powerful."" But if Tahajjud is the one that everyone does to get their duas a guaranteed answer, what's the point of Salatul Hajat? 

So like my original question, which is more powerful? Salatul Hajat or Tahajjud?"
157,"Hello everyone! I’m a philosophy student at the University at Albany and I’m doing research about the viewpoints of different religions and practices. I decided that I would love to reach out to people with different perspectives! In particular, about Aristotelean virtues. I believe that hearing from people themselves is much more valuable than just looking it up online. 

Anyway, if you’d like, would you want to answer some questions about your practices’ views on virtues? You can answer as many or as few as you’d like. I’m not weighing the results against each other, just seeing the similarities and differences with Aristotle! I am also aware that each religion and practice has so much diversity, so if you’d like you could just tell me about your own if applicable!

Aristotle’s virtues are wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. Aristotle says that these virtues come from within and are honed throughout our lifetime. 

So, these are the questions I've come up with:

1. Out of the virtues I mentioned above, which three are the most important, or the most emphasized in your practice, and why? If there’s others that are important, please feel free to mention them!

2. In your practice, where do virtues come from? Aristotle says that they are honed within us over our lifetimes- how about yours? Do they come from a higher power, from the universe, from yourself, etc? 

3. For Aristotle, “eudaimonia” is the highest possible good a person can be, without using it as a means to an end. Eudaimonia is achieved by living virtuously, or living with moral excellence. What does your practice say about how we can achieve this peak good?

4. What does acting virtuous look like in the daily life of someone who is involved in your practice?

Thank you so much! Your feedback is very appreciated."

159,I recently started learning Cryptocurrency trading and had this question in my mind.
160,"
I am a 21 year old Muslim girl who would love to marry a Muslim man who is 25. We love each other and have known each other for a very long time (5 years). I had tried many times to make this halal and getting married by bringing this information to my mom over the years. But her response was always to finish my education first. Finally, after 4 years, she agreed to meet with him and my father also agreed. My parents are divorced and I do not live with my dad. I live with my mom. My mother was against it from the beginning due to cultural differences and also wealth status. My father however, was very approving and said that he is supportive and thinks that the man is of good religious character. My mom reluctantly agreed and said we have to have an ""engagement"". Which does not mean anything in Islam but I agreed. The guys family agreed to this engagement but simply requested that men and women be separated during the event. My mom didn't like this and said there is nothing wrong with men and women mingling and nobody should come to her house and tell her what to do. Eventually, we had our engagement. When we had begun to plan for our nikkah, me and the man and my father had all agreed that we will have a small nikkah with no music or dancing. My mom disagreed with this. She wanted a huge hall, with hundreds of people, music, and men and women dancing together because that is how traditional weddings are. She also wanted me to spend excessive amounts of money such as buying a wedding dress for 5000 dollars instead of using that money on a future house. The man I want to marry became stern and said that he cannot agree with having a wedding that goes against Allah (swt) terms. My mom believed this to be very disrespectful and came to a point where she delayed the nikkah and wedding and said she doesn't want it to happen right now. She had started to find issues with his family such as ""they are cheap. They are going to make you a maid, they are not going to let you work, he has a horrible attitude, he does not spend enough money on you, he wants everything his way."" My mom had also begun to tell all of our family and friends that he is not a good person. She also made many rude comments about the family without any logic or evidence or truth. She said that they are very weird making food for us when we went over to their house, even though this was a very nice act. Additionally, she makes assumptions about them based on stereotypes and their culture. I went and told my dad about all that is happening, and he said to be patient because we cannot upset your mom. I was patient and waited because she wanted to delay the nikkah. But eventually she said ""I only delayed it because I wanted you to stop talking to him. But you didn't."" So now she is forbidding me from marrying him at all. She said it will not happen unless the wedding happens exactly her way with music and dancing and men and women mingling. My older brothers are also against me and say that they will disown me and kick me out if I make this choice to marry him. I truly love him and he has done nothing wrong. I told my dad this information and he said that he cannot do anything as to not upset my mom. What can I do? I am very depressed and miserable"

Salamalikom, brothers,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and iman. I come to you today seeking solace, guidance, and understanding. At the young age of 22, I find myself feeling lost and adrift in the vast sea of life. The weight of the future presses heavily on my shoulders, and anxiety clouds my thoughts. I am struggling with a deep sense of disconnection, feeling the gaps widen between me and Allah.

I find myself in a constant battle, questioning my faith, my purpose, and my place in this world. The stability I once knew seems elusive, replaced by a feeling of being tossed about by the storms of life. The pressure to succeed, to be a good Muslim, and to live up to the expectations placed upon me feels overwhelming.

I am haunted by the fear that I am not doing my worship right, that my prayers are empty, and my heart is far from Allah. The distance I feel is both physical and spiritual, and it weighs heavily on my soul.

In reaching out to this community, I seek not only your understanding but also your wisdom. How do you navigate the uncertainties of life while staying close to Allah? How do you find stability in the midst of life's chaos? Have you ever felt this way, and if so, how did you overcome it?

I am open to any advice, any words of wisdom, or even personal stories that might shed light on my path. Your support means the world to me, and I am hopeful that, with your guidance and the mercy of Allah, I can find my way back to Him and rediscover the peace that seems so elusive right now.

JazakAllah khair for taking the time to read my message. May Allah bless you all and grant you strength and wisdom in your own journeys.

163,"Asalamualaikum all! 

I’m a revert. I took my shahada around 5 months ago. I have done almost a full 180 on my life from the person i used to be & i love it. I’ve stopped every sin i used to do before i was a muslim except one.

I have an addiction to vaping. It’s embarrassing to say because vaping usually doesn’t seem as bad as some other things. But, it’s something that i struggle with daily. Every day i tell myself i want to quit. I think “what if i don’t wake up tomorrow. How will i answer to Allah SWT?” 

I guess i’m just wondering if anyone has any advice to quit. Cold turkey doesn’t really work for me (i’ve tried it multiple times. I’ve thrown it away, given it to friends or family who don’t vape, etc.) I really wanna quit.

Thank you all"
164,"i am 18 years old and a girl (obviously lol) and im born into a muslim egyptian family in the US but only just started to become serious about practicing about a year ago. before i practiced islam but my parents never got me excited or joyful about religion, they just made it seem like a chore, so only at the beginning of my senior year of high school (i’m currently a college freshman) did i begin to form a deeper personal connection with Allah swt. i have changed up my wardrobe to make it much more modest and stopped wearing heavy makeup alhamdulilah, so my next step is putting on hijab permanently. i already own a bunch of hijabs and abayas and wear them whenever i go to my local masjid.

however, my parents are apprehensive. every time i bring up wanting to become a hijabi they freak out and ask if i’m sure, tell me i still have time, tell me not to rush into it even though it’s been on my mind for months. my mom is an ex-hijabi and took hers off when she moved to the States. i’m guessing she doesn’t want me to put it on for the wrong reasons like she did, but i feel like she’s projecting her problems onto me. at least she still believes it’s Fardh though (my dad has told me many times that it’s not Fardh which is just categorically false but i don’t argue with him i just politely tell him that it is Fardh and even if it wasn’t i’d still want to.) but for some reason they are still hesitant to accept it. every time they see me wearing hijab they call me “ya set el 7aga” (egyptian slang for an old lady), which they think is funny but after the 80th time it just gets annoying.

and don’t get me started on my family in egypt. they all tell me that i’m still young and i should have fun and dress how i want. i tell them that i can still have fun while wearing hijab and my idea of fun doesn’t involve immodest dress, and i can still wear what i want in front of my immediate family and female friends, but everything i say falls on deaf ears.

any advice on convincing my parents? i don’t have to convince my extended family but i would love some advice on dealing with them as well. i just want my parents to let me make this choice for myself and take me seriously instead of treating me like im 12. jazakallah khair!!! :)"

Please make du’a for her. 

She’s been walking wobbly, passing blood in her stool, severely dehydrated, won’t eat or drink, pretty much all the nightmares. I have been devastated. But I won’t give up in the mercy of Allah SWT. Please keep her in your duas.

174,"Salaam, 

I’ve never done this before so a little unsure on how it all works but In’sha’Allah will try my best. 

I’m really unsure if Allah is angry with me or if I’ve got some sort of blockages in my life. 

I know I’m not an amazing Muslim but I try my upmost best. I pray my 5 daily salah, I wake up for tahajjad, i fast, give my zakat, give charity, repent etc. 
I feel like I keep facing blocked doors in life, one rejection after another. I can’t seem to get a job and when I do, I can’t seem to keep it. I’ve done many courses to improve myself and my cv, I keep making dua and of course, applying to jobs etc. I can’t seem to pass my driving test despite taking so many lessons and tests, my instructor also keeps saying he doesn’t seem to understand what happens because I drive really well. I can’t seem to get married, my wedding has been called off twice for silly reasons. My relationship with my parents is very bitter but I still always go out of my way to try for them, to keep them happy

Despite all this, I didn’t let go of my imaan. I kept trying to please Allah, I do optional ibadah in the hope of His mercy. I keep making dua, keep knocking on His doors yet nothing seems to open? Nothing seems to change? I’m extremely upset and confused, I don’t understand. I keep trying to believe that Allah loves me but how do I keep believing that? How do I keep having hope? If Allah isn’t angry then what are all of these blockages? And how do I remove them? Is this sihr or am I paying for some sin I don’t remember about? 

Any (kind) advise will very much be appreciated. Please help this sister. May Allah reward you all"
175,so i have missed many many prayers and really am trying to change my ways 😞 i heard that if you pray sunnah prayers allah swt may consider that for each prayer you’ve missed so my question is what are the sunnah prayers to pray before/after each salah? i’m hanafi muslim if that is relevant at all

178,"Narrated Abu Hurayrah: The Prophet (sly) said: There is no prophet between me and him, that is, Jesus (ey). He will descent (to the earth). When you see him, recognise him: a man of medium height, reddish fair, wearing two light yellow garments, looking as if drops were falling down from his head though it will not be wet. He will fight the people for the cause of Islam. He will break the cross, kill swine, and abolish jizyah. Allah will perish all religions except Islam. He will destroy the Antichrist and will live on the earth for forty years and then he will die. The Muslims will pray over him Reference: Sunan Abu Dawud, Book #39, Hadith 34

Does this mean Isa(PBUH) will be born as a human with such characteristics, or will he have descended from heaven with the same physical body.

I am fully conscious of Sharia but I know that if I only stick to Muslim influencers then the span of my market is severely cut and I wouldn't be able to profit much. How can I go about this?

185,"As salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh. So I am a Muslim male (18) in the US who's been muslim since 15. To be honest, ever since I was like 16, marriage was vaguely on my mind. But, realistically, I knew there was no way it could possibly even happen at all. So fast forward a while, and now I am/was looking at colleges, but I'm still in my last year of high school. That said, there was still muslima in one of my classes who seemed to be wearing correct hijab and had haya2. I guess that probably perked up my interest a bit. But I actually didn't think too much about it and went on about my life. And besides, college would be yet another big obstacle to getting married... right? 

&#x200B;

Anyhow, one day for whatever reason, I really wished I had a wife, as I usually would/still do, and so I just made du'a one night pretty nonchalantly for a righteous spouse. A little while after that (I don't remember exactly how long after), suddenly an idea sprouted in my head! (looking back, maybe it wasn't very smart) College wasn't neccisarily an obstacle, but rather it could be the solution I needed. Just like every other year 12 muslim man, I'm a little broke. I only have like $1000 in my bank account give or take. But college could definitley cover the whole food and housing thing at least till I could get a job right? So thats the idea that popped up. I could just go to the same uni as a girl and get married with her, or so I thought. Anyhow, it wasn't a very strong idea. It was just an idea at that point; not a plan  


Around the same time, I seemed to start developing an attraction to the aforementioned muslima. Both the idea and this muslima went from unimportant and small thoughts in my mind to serious considerations. I started thinking about it a lot. So I decided to ask some different people I know, and see if this was a bad idea (the whole thing - getting married at this age) and I got different answers. Some were absolutley set against this, and thought it was a horrible idea to get married at this age. Some were in between and thought it might be able to work out but also were somewhat skeptical, and there were some who were diehard for it.  


So after about 2 weeks of my feelings growing at a rather unstable rate, I figured; If I can just get her wali's contact info and meet her (with wali around), I can see if I am up to this, or I should give up on it. No commitments, just meeting and seeing if it could work, or they would even be accepting towards it at all. After meeting my older good friend (who is muslim), who happens to be married, and talking about it, I was set on doing it. He was more in the middle camp that I mentioned earlier, but he seemed like it might work out. He also mentioned I shouldn't be unaware that I might get rejected and it would hurt a lot in that case. Anyhow, eventually, I just made my move. I was nervous about it, but I figured I should either just do nothing, or just do it. So I decided to do it. Long story short: I approached her at a good time and asked her for her dads number, and she politely rejected me.  


Now I'm a bit crushed. I don't resent her, as ultimately it's her choice, but it did really hit me hard. I knew my chances of getting super far with this were definitely not 100%, but I didn't expect to get rejected THIS early. That hit me pretty hard and made me question myself.  


Anyhow, now I'm having a bit of a hard time coping, considering how my hopes quickly soaring up and then fell down quicker. Now I feel lethargy and have a hard time even doing schoolwork or college application things.   


I'm sorry for the rant, I just wanted to get my feelings out. Also I wrote this super quickly so it will probably be very cringe and messy.   


So my question is, could anyone give me any advice or insight? Something to help focus on schoolwork and whatnot again? I would appreciate basically anything you could say that would help my situation even a little."

The purpose of this short list of intellectual understandings and their associated felt/sensed emotions is to cultivate stronger levels of Brain-Heart Coherence. These can be kept in mind/heart while performing a daily dhikr practice where one selects a particular phrase and melodiously repeats it a number of times in pure solitude. This can also be kept in mind/heart throughout daily activities when one encounters a situation that invokes a one-time remembrance internally (in the heart as a feeling or in the mind as a thought) and/or externally as in speech while in the company of others.

Note: these descriptions are my own and by no means authoritative 

~ Audhu Bilahi Min Ash Shaytan Ar Rajeem

Intellect: When seeking refuge in Allah SWT, from shaytan, whose heart has hardened to stone and whispers into the hearts of others, inviting them towards impure thoughts, actions and etiquettes. Knowing that shaytan is not only an external entity, but that with the collusion and willful submission of the ego, the two can infiltrate the inner Kingdom of Man and imprison the soul.

Heart: Feelings of safety/security/balance in the seeking of Allah’s SWT refuge from the known and unknown trappings of the ego and shaytan.

~ Bismillah Ar Rahman Ar Raheem

Intellect: Knowing that (according to Awliyaullah (ق)) the whole of the Qur’an is contained within the 7 verses of Surah Fatiha and that these 7 verses are contained within the Bismillah, which is contained within the Nuqt (dot, point or seed) under the ب out of which all of creation expands. All of creation is Bismillah: with/by/in the Name of Allah SWT, The Gracious, The Merciful.

Heart: Seeking the “withness” of Allah SWT, feeling the grace and mercy contained in the womb of a mother (from which the two Names Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem are derived). A sense of trust, protection and confidence in preceding new beginnings with His Name.

~ SubhanAllah

Intellect: When meeting something in creation which reminds us of Allah’s SWT Glory. 

Heart: Feelings of astonishment/amazement/awe/reverence.

~ Alhamdulilah

Intellect: When meeting something in creation that invokes Allah’s SWT Praise, which is often erroneously attributed to oneself and/or others.

Heart: Feelings of gratitude/thankfulness/relief/security/contentment/abundance. 

~ La Ilaha Il Allah

Intellect: The understanding and conviction that all is Allah SWT, only His existence is Real and all else is nothing but illusion, delusion, distraction and falsehood.

Heart: Feelings of surrender/effacement/nothingness of the self/abandonment of the ego and shaytan/returning to Him the false sense of autonomy/returning to Him the false sense of having a will that is separate to His.

~ Allahu Akbar

Intellect: When meeting something in creation that reminds one of Allah’s SWT Greatness.

Heart: Sense of littleness/humility in the Presence of Allah’s SWT Vastness/Limitlessness/Infinitude and confidence that His Control and Authority is above all else.

~ La Hawla Wa La Quwwata Ila Bilah Al Aliyy Al Adheem

Intellect: All might and power observed in creation is derived solely from His Might and His Power. Nothing possesses these except through Him, The Most High, The Magnificent.

Heart: Feelings of reassurance that His Power and His Might is above all. Nothing can reach, harm or overpower us except by His permission. Only through Him can we be shielded and only through Him can we overcome weakness and shortcomings.

“Verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.”

One matter that May see so basic is saying PBUH after saying Muhammad. 

Isn’t our a Prophet (PBUH)  already in Jannah? 

If so, saying peace be upon him seems a bit obvious. If Muhammad (PBUH) is already in Jannah, he already has peace. 

For me, my brain thinks peace be upon him is a request. But if it’s already given, it’s not a request.

I've been a Orthodox Christian for most my life, with me falling out of touch with religion a few years ago, and coming back now. I have been very interested in Islam, but with little knowledge on how to convert/practise Islam, and all my Muslim family being overseas, I've been stuck.

Recently (on the first of October) After not being able to sleep till 2 AM, I got up and while cleaning a shelf in my living room, I found a Quran that nobody in my family knows about, next to some random books. I brought it back to my room, flicked through it in curiosity and sat it near my bed, as I got incredibly sleepy. I then had a dream where I was in a very fast sort of garden, with a field, and I had converted to Islam. I then left the garden, witnessed myself die and get reincarnated, and then in a world consisting of the colours green, purple and orange, I came in contact with a faceless figure in robes, who insited to fix and heal me although me declining and claiming I was

perfectly fine. After he touched my shoulder, everything went bright, and I woke up around 5 AM. Knowing not much about Islam, I'm very curious if this dream was significant, or if it was my imagination running crazy."

203,"- Forgive Your Past Mistakes/Sins And Learn To Be At Peace With Your Past, And Never Let It Haunt You Or Bring You To Despair From Allah (SWT).

215,"There are a lot of things in Islam that I wouldn’t have accepted if I didn’t have the perspective that ultimately Allah created morality and that He knows better than us. I see a lot of Muslims when they’re questioning other religions they bring up how they couldn’t possible have the right morality because of so and so in their religion, but I was wondering why this is an argument that Muslims use since if they truly believe in their religion they would believe that their “god” couldnt possible have the wrong morality. I don’t know if I’m explaining this well but something feels off everytime I hear Muslims use that argument"
216,"Asslamualaikum, I have questions regarding the Quran and it’s similarities to the bible.

The Quran is Allah’s word written and composed by his creation. It is Gods word, but compiled by Sahabi. Don’t Christians believe the same thing about the Bible? What’s the difference between the two ideas?

I know Quran hasn’t been changed and the bible has. What else is there?"
218,"Salam brothers and sisters,
I’ve been having a debate with a Christian and I had great arguments but now I’m honeslty just confused what their point is/what they’re trying to argue. Can anyone help me out InshaAllah? My main point was that it’s not in the nature of god for him to need to sacrifice anyone, especially his “son” (according to their belief) to forgive when he can simply just forgive. I also mentioned it’s not logical that any human being would be born with sin and if they were how is that fair that one person had to bear everyone’s sin, and pay for something he didn’t even do. 

Her responses to me: including my text would make this too long 

I get that. But what God says stands. He said that no sin goes unpunished. Obviously since he‘s just. Nothing we do can just take that away. 

 but yeah, God is merciful. He is so merciful that he came down into flesh to free us from that unbearable payment, that we could never afford.

 Okay makes sense but again, how is that enough? Let‘s say you‘ve commited a crime and stand in front of a judge. He tells you your bail, which you can‘t afford. How does you doing good things, pay off that fine? I just thing those two things are seperate if you understand😅

 Submiting your life to God by following Christ, Following his word, and denying our flesh. But also regarding that people could never be sinfree, hence why, Jesus Christ died on the cross for us


 I think the Islam takes away Gods character. H being 100% and staying on his word. God is the realest as real could get and if he was just
 to ignore our sins by disregarding his own Words, that wouldn‘t make him 100% real anymore. Hence why he made a way for us to bypass that law, and get to him. 

 I aready kinda explained it but yeah. What God says stands. I believe in the Bible so if God says: „no sin shall go unpunished“ doing good deeds won‘t take that away. If God just erases your sins because you did something good, that would contradict his original sentence. So how is God left to be perfect 

I also said he died for us to bypass that law. Islam doesn’t believe in Jesus, so there is no bypassing for you. There is just too much to explain"

So today I watched an interesting video about [The Zipf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE&pp=ygUQdGhlIHppcGYgbXlzdGVyeQ%3D%3D)[ Mystery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE&pp=ygUQdGhlIHppcGYgbXlzdGVyeQ%3D%3D) by Vsuace. This law applies to books written by humans in all languages.

It is also safe to say this law applies to the bible and books whether they are fictional or non-fictional.

**And yet... And yet...** against all mathematical odds that govern reality itself, the Quran doesn't adhere to this law like all the books that were written by humans. It is a book that clearly violates the Zipf law.

In the video, Vsuace couldn't give a definitive answer for why the law works on humans considering that we make free choices. But regardless of why, it wouldn't change the fact that we--humans--are living proof of this law.

And then you have the Quran. Of course, it is being a book that was not created by humans, the Quran will not be restricted by rules that govern humans.

The only workaround against this law is knowing of it's existence beforehand. And for everyone reading this. The science of statistics didn't exist 1500 years ago. Not to mention people knowing the Zipf law.

Proof: First watch the above video about the Zipf law to double-check my claims. Then you can proceed to read this article:

223,"From the Timurids to the Seljuks, to the Mamluks, to the Mughals, even the Safavids, and finally to the Ottomans, at one point \~3/4 of the Muslim world was under Turkish rule. Even the star and crescent(I know it has nothing to do with Islam) came from the Turks, specifically the Ottoman Empire. The only parts of the Muslim world Turks didn't rule over I think were southeast Asia and parts of Africa. Why is this the case? Why not Persians or Arabs?"
224,"A friend of mine is a non-muslim and is interested in learning more. Since we're in the west, I thought it could be a good idea to visit a predominantly Muslim country to get a sense of true Islam and it's people.

I've seen stories where locals invite tourists into their home and are very kind to them, so I'm looking for that kind of experience that could be a true representation of the way Muslims treat people"
225,"Assalamu al laikum! As a child I’ve always been taught that all non believers, who know about Islam but choose to ignore it and follow other religions will go to hell. However, in Surah Baqarah it says in verse 62, “Indeed the believers, Jews, Christians, and Sabians whoever truly believes in God and the Last Day and does good will have their reward with their Lord.” Does this mean that even non-Muslims can go to heaven? Also, Christians and Jews don’t believe in the same things as us but they do believe in God and the Last Day, so is that why they also may go to heaven?"

227,"Something terrible happened at work. I tried to have this casual conversation with a worker. Of course, being friendly was stupid of me, because apparently they had mental issues and interpreted my friendliness as intimidating.

And that worker is super close to this senior worker at the place I work. Of course, this senior worker was biased to the worker I ""intimidated"" and now falsely believes me to intentionally intimidate that worker. THAT'S NOT TRUE! I just wanted to have a friendly introduction. Now she's being unprofessional in the workplace, being unreasonable, treating me cruelly,  threatening to hit me, unjustly scolding me for any work mistake I do. She won't even listen to me and give me the chance to explain myself. If I do get the chance, she doesn't even want to consider that maybe I'm telling the truth. It's Hell for me. I want to quit, but the boss won't even let me. Heck, even the senior worker won't even let me.

What's the ruling on this? I know that slander is a huge sin in Islam, but technically they're not slandering, right? Slander is when the slanderers know that what they're saying is a lie, but these people in my workplace legitimately believe that I did that wrong thing. So they can't be judged like slanderers, but at the same time, I'm suffering. Not being able to explain myself, not giving me the chance to prove I meant no harm. I'm innocent but they won't even give me a chance. They're not slandering, but this isn't justice."

I amam going to move away from home this upcoming summer for college and alhamdullilah I plan to start visiting the masjid by my school. So my question is, does the shahada I took by myself a few months ago count? Or do I have to make the declaration “officially” when I start going to the masjid? I also really want to visit Mecca at some point in the future and I've heard that as a revert you need to have a written acknowledgement from an imam that your reversion was sincere, but I converted in my own heart without any imam being able to bear witness to it.

235,"Hello I am in need of some help so first off anything i say that may come across as rude or insensitive is not intended to and i apologize in advance I identify as a Christian with that being said I have been studying Islam and am trying interested in learning more but I have a few questions like for one 

(#1)Muhammad was a war leader so it would be in his best interest to essentially convince people that if you die fighting for him you will be gifted a beatiful paradise (heaven) where as Jesus gained absolutely nothing by convincing people to follow him that indeed he actually lost everything as a result so that's my first problem is who the prophet was compared to Jesus secondly
 
(#2) one of the reasons I buy into Christianity is that there is archeological evidence that supports the bible and almost all manuscripts line up with each other with around 90% accuracy so let's say you have 5 thousend manuscripts and two of them have or don't an event the other 4,998 had then we know those two manuscripts are false so what proof outside of the quran is there outside of the ""logic Muhammad said so"" then what other proof but now on the other hand I like the tradition of Islam (self discipline,putting GOD at the first of everything,nasheed,modesty) I often times find myself listening to nasheed because there's one I listen to (I don't have the name on the top of my head) and I think there's valid points to both religions like I've saw some of the scientific miracles of quran such as (he has set free the two seas meeting together there Is a barrier between them they do not transgress) and the Atlantic and pacific ocean do not mix at a certain point and 

(#3)3rdly I have trouble believing the quran is PERFECTLY preserved because from my knowledge people say the reason it's been perfectly preserved is by memorization well its very difficult to memorize a WHOLE BOOK and like in Christianity the Manuscripts date back to shortly after Jesus and keyword manuscripts meaning it was written down meaning paper does not forget our mind does and the quran was not assembled until after Muhammad death so even if he was a prophet how can we be sure that the quran of 2023 is the exact same to the quran of 700 ad because human memory is one of the if not the very worst form of preservation i mean the game telaphone proves that and I thought the quran said the bible was valid and also why would god wait 600 years to set the truth straight but on a happy note again I enjoy the music and the culture I'm just not fully convinced that it's the one true religion and have been looking into it again I mean no harm my last post post was removed so I tried to update the title"

239,"Hello, atheist speaking but eager to learn from your knowledge.  

For some time now I have been investigating, out of curiosity and for pure intellectual pleasure, how Islam is articulated, and the first thing I find is, indeed, sectarian behavior. When I talk about ""sectarian behavior,"" I'm not talking about sects designed to steal your money and make you a slave, but about real divisions that are difficult to understand. Of course, in every religion there are schools of thought or ""fiqh"" but it all gets more and more complicated the more you investigate. 

First we have the Sunnis, who are the majority. Within the Sunnis, we have four schools of thought (some will add a few more, like the Zahirites who have basically been swallowed up by Hanbalism); and between these they differ radically in many concepts; Then, among them, we have those who are Maturidis, ashaaris or athari. The Maturidis call the Atharis anthropomorphists, the Atharis call the Ashaaris logicalists without the capacity for analysis, literalists. A chaos. And then, the mix between ""madhab"" and ""aqeedah"" that complicates things even more. 

Then we have the ""sunnah-shia"" division which, for a layman, complicates things intellectually, because you really don't know who to trust. Abu Bakr or Ali Ibn Talib as the legitimate political-religious successor of Muhammad? Various conspiracies, Umayyads, each side with its version of the issues and in the end, the elementary principle of ""trusting the narrators of your particular sect"" 

And then, in between, we have ""outsiders"" like the ""kharijites"" or the Sufis who are fluid and can go from Shiism to Sunnism in the purest esoteric and among them, there are divisions, ""tariqas"", teachers and an unlimited list of interpretative baggage not of Islam, but of their own contemplative practices. 

And then, of course, even more outsiders, the Quranists. 

Simply speaking of ""Islam"" as a unified concept seems difficult to me, beyond very elementary principles, which still remain disputed; Intellectually, it is extremely exhausting, not in the sense of researching all this, but because I am realizing that it leads nowhere. It all leads to the undaunted faith of some narrators over others and the principle that ""the Ummah of Muhammad would not go astray"", but not a forceful statement of what Islam is built around beyond the universal acceptance of the Quran as a starting point . 

Kind regards."
240,"Salaam all,

We are always told that everything is already written for us and we should have sabr. That what is meant for us will not miss us and what is not meant for us cannot be ours. But, what about our own actions that result in consequences? I keep kicking myself for not marrying when I was younger and starting a family, but how much of where I am today is because of my choices and how much is because that is what was already meant for me?  Please help clarify this, because I am not in a good place right now."

243,"I have recently been struggling with comparing myself/my life to others. 
For instance, I compare myself to those with no faith/iman who don’t pray etc and are getting everything they want/need. I pray daily, and my faith has been steadfast but recently I think my lack of tawakkul mixed with anxiety makes me compare my life to others who just seem happier than me, more financially stable than me and so on. I think I keep doing this more often since I am struggling in a few areas of my life, like my career. Regardless, I always do my dhikr, dua and I have recently been praying tahajjud consistently everyday for around 2 weeks which has helped with my stress and anxiety. I once heard somewhere that Allah swt gives money to those who He loves and those who He does not, but He only gives iman to those He loves - unsure if this authentic or not but I try to remind myself of this.

Any advice would be appreciated."
244,"Assalamu Alakum brothers and sisters, hope all is well Insha Allah. Background on me is I am a 21 year old Muslim brother in the United States of central Asian descent. I am using a throwaway I have almost never used. Anyways, over the last year I have really been working on trying to be a better Muslim. I go to every jummah prayer, I pray 5 times a day now (I have trouble being able to pray fajr on time some days but I am working on this), I have been trying to avoid using bad language despite formerly doing it a lot. Basically I was a not even bare-minimum Muslim even though I was still following the majority of customs but now I’m trying to truly be practicing. I am making more Muslim friends too. However I have been far from perfect. 

In February of this year, there was this girl at my university who I became friends with. She was East Asian Buddhist, which meant it would not be Halal to marry her unless she converted to Islam (Christianity or Judaism too but I’d rather just marry Muslim). We got close to where we would get lunch on or off campus between our classes in the two days a week we were both on campus. We also had each other snapchats and would snap each other back and forth throughout the day. Unfortunately I did develop feelings for her and she did for me too, as she would then tell me almost 3 months into our friendship in May. I told her I do have feelings too but we won’t ever be able to get married unless she converts, and she understood and we agreed to just stay friends.

The problem is we stayed just as close as we were before this happened. The rest of the school year (the next two weeks) was like that, and throughout the summer (until late august) even though we never hung out we still snapped each other back and forth. I did lose feelings for her eventually though. Anyways in august we reunite in person for the first time since last spring due to school being back and we get lunch and she tells me that she dated a guy for a good amount of June and that it didn’t last after a few dates and that the reason she would be snapping me later than usual at night would be because she would be up at night calling him. Anyways if she moves on she moves on but why would she still act like my best friend yet have this full on double life and make me look foolish and naive about? Anyways I told her I was hurt that she was not being trustworthy to me and she apologized. We still stayed just as close unfortunately for the next 1+ months until yesterday, where some things led me to believe she got a new boyfriend and once again I’m being gatekept from as her best friend.

So even though she doesn’t realize I deduced this, I decided to tell her I should’ve never trusted her and removed her on Snapchat, removed her on discord, and unfollowed and removed her on Instagram. She messaged me on discord soon after asking if we can talk and is confused why I did what I did, so I sent a long paragraph to her about how untrustworthy she was and how in the long term she and I should not be friends given our history and given that nothing more was going to come out of this friendship. She blocked me soon after. While I understand this is for the best, as I was friends with a girl and even worse she wasn’t even a religion I can marry, and this was a rabbit hole I never should have gotten myself into in the first place, part of me does feel bad for how I came about it and part of me misses what friendship we did have. We never made any kind of physical contact but doesn’t mean our connection was Halal. I don’t have many friends with that I’m anywhere as close to. 

But is there anything I should do on my end to remind myself or better understand how this decision will pay off later on? I just want to get all of this off my mind. 

TLDR: Became very close friends with a Buddhist girl at my college, we liked each other but understood we couldn’t be together, she acted untrustworthy later down the line and I got hurt and eventually cut her off with final messages for her and she blocked me.

JazakhAllah!"

248,"It’s all a lie

Hey guys. Been through a lot in the past two years and just wanted to share quite a personal story with others in hopes of reaching out to people who may be going through the same. This is quite a long post so bear with me. 

I used to be quite a good muslim in my last year of high school. Prayed everyday, read Quran regularly, did acts of sunnah and so forth. Islam was a big part of my identity and albeit life wasn’t 100% great, a lot of things in life were still going great. Idk what it was but it just felt like i had some kinda direct pipeline with Allah, where I’d ask for something and I’d get like 97% of the things I’d asked for when I’d put in the slightest efforts to get those things. 

Unfortunately all this came to an end when I started college. Ironically I used to make fun of the muslims who had no self control when it comes to indulging in weed, alcohol and porn. I started to develop these habits as I hung around wrong company. I indulged in all these things frequently and literally lost myself. I thought these things would make me happy and bring me joy as everyone says they do. The ‘fun’ in life they sell you. Drugs, alcohol, porn, zina. All of it. It’s just one big lie. They’ve got ppl in this world thinking that all those mentioned above are all ‘normal’ things that people take part in when they let loose and relax. 

As a result my life was horrible. I would lie in bed almost everyday and waste an abseloutely disgusting amount of time just scrolling through my phone. That, with junk food almost every other day along with an addiction to pornography. I was the lowest I have ever been. I spent a good 1 and a ½ year just like this. My life was stuck in an endless loop and I was falling into a bottomless pit. I tried praying now and then and said I’d change from tomorrow. But never did. I gave up each and every time. 

A month ago I was met with a life threatening situation. I was quite suicidal as my life depended on it. Where does one go when they have lost all hope? God. I was there up at 3am in the morning, praying tahajjud, and every single rakat during salah, praying and crying my heart out for Allah to save me and to forgive me for all that I’ve done. Fast forward to a few weeks and by Allah’s miracle I managed to get through. I genuinely couldn’t believe it when all that stuff I was going through was finally behind me. I was finally able to breathe again. 

It’s been a couple weeks now. I’m always up for tahajjud and never miss a prayer. And I’m not even joking, I feel like the best I have ever felt in 2 years. Just feels like I’ve got my life back in my hands again. No amount of drugs, alcohol, sex has ever made me feel this good. Happily quit all those things for good and am working towards becoming a much better person. 

Don’t fall into the trap of the duniya. All it will do is make you numb. It’s never too late to turn back, no matter what you’ve done. For he is all forgiving 🙏🏽

Edit: Awed by the level of support from this wholesome community. Thank u guys ❤️. Will always come back to this post whenever this duniya may try to get to me. Your comments will always give me the reason to never give up and turn away from the path im on ✊🏽."
249,"Salaam all.

I (M16) was in a (haram) relationship which I ended around 10 months ago due to my Iman becoming stronger and me realising that this person is not worth sacrificing my religion for.  However, as a result of the individual (lets call them JR) I have been quite plagued and worried for my future. 

The relationship I had with JR was a very toxic and abusive one (from her side). she would constantly threaten suicide if I left her or if and when I did things that did not please her. This unfortunately extended to sexual activity. 

At the time my Iman was definitely not as strong as it is today. My partner at the time effectively forced me to engage in sexual activity through things like threats to hurt herself or sometimes things that were even worse. being the naive individual i was scared that she would actually take her own life, so I conformed to such demands. This is something I regret deeply. 

When I protested about this, and the relationship in general, in the name of religion, her response would be evasive and she would find a way to blame me which led to her screaming at me and getting physical. After realising the behaviour exhibited by her was not normal, over a few months I started to question why I even was in this relationship in the first place. I ended it, not caring about the fallout and honestly with a focus on my iman and religion.  I don't want to deflect from the fact that I willingly entered a haram relationship, but the impact it had on me was something I never expected.

My question, and the need for advice, comes from the fact that I am troubled with the fact that my experience with sexual intimacy comes from an abusive place one which I did not enjoy, and yet it will impact me in regards to marriage. How do I cope with this and the fact that it will be a potential turn off for partners?  

I have repented endlessly for the Zina I committed. 

Thank you to all of those who will respond. "

I have a longer consistent with my prayers being on time and I also have not been reading the Quran every day for some while and have been spending too much time on video games and other social media, due to this I am having some conflicts with my beliefs after looking into some atheist subreddits and I having questioning if Islam indeed is the right religion but I know deep down it is but for some reason, I still have that feeling of doubt. Because of all this I also have been doing poorly in school, I used to be a top 10 student but now I am at the bottom of my [class](https://class.SO), and this is my last year of school before my GC exams and I want to study and become a mechanical engineer or something that is of high standard. When I realized all this I tried to quit my addictions and try to be a better Muslim, as I was watching dawah I got to know about the different levels of Jannah, and I have a fear of not getting the highest level of Jannah and forever being on a lower level of Jannah (I know each and every level of Jannah will fulfill all of our desire but I still want the highest). Even though I know all this I have no drive to do anything.  
**So I need some help, I want to:**  
\> Get closer to Allah and increase my Iman  
\>Follow the prophet Mohamed (saw)'s way of life and learn the sunnah

260,"TLDR: Can you further go into detail why Jesus wasn’t crucified and how do we know given modern historians say he was. 

Hi all! So I’ll give a brief overview of how I think so hopefully that may help guide the answer to this some. I am VERY factual and historically oriented.

I began looking at Islam because I was raised Christian and I noticed a lot of historical errors in the Bible, specifically the New Testament (look up slaughter of the innocents). This coupled with the fact I couldn’t ever understand why God couldn’t just..forgive our sins? This almighty creator had to kill his Son when he had the power to just say forgiven? It bothered me. 

So I looked at Islam and the ONLY thing I’m just super hung up on is the crucifixion. This is because it is well accepted by secular and non-secular historians that Jesus was crucified. I have heard the story of it could’ve been Jesus Barabbas and it made some sense but not enough. Was hoping someone here could give further guidance! 

Thanks in advance!"
261,"So for context, i am from the Ahmadiyya/Qadiani  community and if you haven’t heard about it then all u need to know that’s it’s basically a cult.

So recently I’ve been having second thoughts about this community that my family and i are a part of. My grandfather was the first one to convert to this Ahmadiyya Community in his 20s and ever since he was been very sincere and loyal to them. When I was having doubts about this Jammat, I started having resentment for my grandfather because he decided to join this cult which is now ruining my life.

He recently came to visit my uncle in the US and them came to Canada to see us and attend the Jalsa(Annual Meeting of the Ahmadiya cult).

A few days after when he’s about to fly back to US he gets a cardiac arrest right before boarding. His death was very sudden and shocking for the whole family.

Here comes the weird part, a week before his death i tell my brother that when my Nana(Grandfather) dies(idk why i said that) i will convert to true islam. And a few days after he passes away very suddenly.

I felt very sad and guilty because of the words that came out of my mouth a few days before his death. 

10 nights go by and i have this dream about my Nana brutally mudering someone in front of me and then burying the body in my backyard and then he walks and talks around the house like nothing happened

I woke up terrified and almost having a panic attack. It was very traumatic. I dont know what to think about this whole co incidence about him dying a few days after what i said about him and then getting this terrifying dream

Idk if’s a sign from God or maybe i am just overthinking."
262,"السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَ بَرَكاتُهُ 

I’ve been debating with an ahmadi and he threw me surah 7:35 stating 

""If prophethood really had ended, the verses should have been in the past tense saying
""Allah chose Messengers"" and ""Messengers came to you"" not in the present tense as stated in the above verse.""


Surah 7:35:

""O children of Adam! When messengers from among yourselves come to you reciting My revelations-whoever shuns evil and mends their ways, there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve.""


I’ve been searching in Ibn Khatir tafsir but it doesn’t dig down that far in this verse. 

Could the verse means that false prophets could come to the umma trying to spread what he would declare as Allah’s words, and that the righteous won’t be misguided ?

265,"Assalamu alaikom. Hello, as a Muslim, I'm curious what your thoughts are about reading Psalms & finding religious/spiritual comfort in it... Personally, most (if not all) of what I've read so far in Psalms do not seem to go against Islamic monotheism. I have not come across a verse the advocates for the Trinity so far... In fact, I truly find a lot of their verses spiritually comforting - as they further bolster my faith in Allah swt.

I am not - yet - fluent in the Arabic language, so perhaps this is also another reason why the Psalms (English version) also more quickly resonates with me.

Sometimes, after I read the Qur'an, I'd also pick up Psalms and reflect on some of its passages. I like how some of those passages remind me about patience / sabr, among other things.

Granted, I know that **only the Holy Qur'an** is regarded as the only scripture that God has promised to be free from any corruption. And thus, we cannot guarantee whether the Psalms we know today is even the original ""Zabur"" / revelations from Prophet Dawud (David).

Regardless, if I don't find contradictory passages from today's Psalms, would it be fine to reflect upon them too, or to use them as ***additional*** tools for spiritual/reflective comfort, as a Muslim?

Thank you so much."
266,"
When we pray we say for example the shahada and we say allahuma sali ala muhammad wa ala alee muhammad. But what did the prophet saw say? Why are we saying it? 

Thanks!"
267,"This has always confused me. I see speakers say something about the prophet, and laugh about the story but it’s not done out of belittlement but they think it’s wholesome and cute. Or one time I said that even though I’m Muslim, I said that a certain sin was tempting and someone said “dang bros about to commit a sin” but when I laughed, it wasn’t out of mockery, I thought more like I was making fun of myself. 

I often feel so confused and get thoughts questioning if it’s kufr and I’m afraid to laugh. Like I don’t get it. If you make a joke or laugh with something to do with Islam but it’s not intended to belittle Islam , is this kufr? I mean I see sheikhs laugh all the time so I’m just confused. Someone once told me how one of the prophets slapped the angel and they laughed and thought it was funny but I was confused and scared as I didn’t know if this considered mockery. Or sometimes when my friends make a joke, I try to steer away from it and laugh from nervousness as I’m not sure if it’s mockery. 

These are some fatwas. One says joking of sin isn’t kufr. Another says making a joke about someone accidentally eating in Ramadan isn’t kufr. Another says laughing without being content isn’t kufr. But then also assim Al Hakeem says any joke that uses elements of Islam is kufr.

I would never intentionally mock Islam knowing full well that the statement was kufr. I just genuinely don’t know what is considered mockery. If I did mock but I didn’t know or was unintentional, does it count as kufr? I’ve always known mocking is kufr, but I never knew what is considered mocking. So sometimes I can’t tell if the voice in my head is just whispers and I’m just exaggerating, or if it’s truly a mockery. Even when better practicing Muslims than me make jokes, I am afraid to laugh as I don’t know what’s a mockery. I mean, is it only when you belittle the religion? I mean what if you just find a lot of things funny?"
268,"Assalamu Alaykum,
I was born into a Muslim family, but Ive been struggling with prayer/remembering allah. Logically, I know that there must be one god (allah) since the earth cannot have created itself, and I know that there must have been a messenger (Muhammad, ASWS), especially because the miracles of the quran are great. Now for the problems:
My parents have been making me take quran classes for as long as I can remember, and I didnt have any strong feelings towards them. I would memorize and be a good student, sometimes I was told I was the best in the class. Howevet, over the past couple of years, Ive been drifting. I haven't been memorizing or reading, sometimes I'd say that i did even though I didn't. Now, I'm taking classes not to memorize but only to read with someone guiding me.
Second, my prayer hasn't been good for a long time now. I never used to pray at all, then I had maybe 6 months where I prayed all my prayers (this was after Ramadan, I had watched an episode that made me want to). Then I traveled with my family and lost that link; it hasn't been the same since. Sometimes Ill pray, butthe majority of yhe time Ill go hide in my room and not pray.
I really do want to become a bettet Muslim. I feel like the reason I havent been as good lately is because I want to learn more about the religion and haven't been learnkng enough. If anyone has some free resources or words of advice to help me, please share! thank you"

I just want to go back to praying give me advices please how to motivate your nafs."

271,"Assalamu Alaikum everyone, i wanted to ask are there any audio books that are translation of quran in a story manner? I've tried reading the literal translation of surahs and it's really cryptic that I don't understand much, i use mobile before sleeping and see insta reels so i thought this time would be better in hearing like 10 20 mins of audio book of quran translation which is in a story or descriptive manner that i can understand the meaning behind it, if there's anything like this please let me know, jazak Allah"

274,"I belong to Pakistan, and recently came across a post saying how much Islam has been modified here by men and how insanely judgmental people can be here.
I didn't really think of it, until I realized this is the reason I really don't feel like becoming a good, practicing muslim.
Here are some examples of that:
-When I was a child, there was this channel we used to watch as kids. Sometimes there was stuff on that channel which was inappropriate, like very rare occasions, but it was kids for majority of the part. My cousins and I were watching TV once, and I insisted on watching that channel. My uncle came at the worst time when some character mentioned sth inappropriate, I don't even remember what it was but I was 10 ig at that time, naïve. He scolded 10 year old me and told me indirectly how I am not a good person bacause I also didn't do hijab. I was 10, made me question if this was all what Islam is about?
- My 5 year old cousin, was not allowed in mosque to pray because this child was wearing shorts reaching his knees. How could Allah not want children to enter mosque?
These are just some very small events which took a real toll, making me hate people iny unconscious mind and as a result hate becoming a good Muslim.
I like how preachers like mufti Menk and Sheikh Assim ul Hakim call out the toxic culture that has been integrated to islam specially here in the subcontinent.
Edit: I understand that this is not an excuse, I'm way older now, and do practice Alhamdulillah. 
It's just that I don't like the way people use deen for their own benefits and disregard it completely when it doesn't deem good to them.
While these events may seem small, but numerous events like these created so many questions in my mind, that looking back, it really did create hindrance in my journey. As someone pointed out, I just feel angry."
275,"I recently took my Shahada, and have been feeling a little isolated in my learning. My partner is Muslim, though I reverted for my own reasons. 

She has been very kind in helping to teach me, but I understand it is difficult for her also to do so. I also feel so self conscious and shy about it that I often get distracted by other things in life and do not focus on what she is trying to teach me. She has helped a lot, and it isn't her fault for my failings, I think I am just afraid of making mistakes and being disrespectful with those mistakes that makes me so. 

In truth it's that I feel self conscious in front of her and embarrassed by my mistakes and how difficult it is for me to learn ... I'm usually good at this kind of thing, yet for this I feel like a newborn and utterly stupid.

I live in Melbourne, and do not have any Muslim friends here - I do have many muslim friends in my life, but they all live in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, so I can't easily go to them for advice.

I barely correctly perform wudu and cannot correctly pray - I've tried YouTube and appa but I still come away from it feeling very self conscious.  I read all the time, I've read the Qur'an and so many different things ... but I still feel overwhelmed by it all.

I know this is my own insecurity at play, but I still feel a bit lost - can anyone offer me some advice or words of encouragement? I want my iman to grow, but I don't know where to start or how to break out of this feeling of doubt in myself."

280,"I've read a Hadith few years ago. And it was something like this that if you ask Allah for forgiveness or cure or anything in the third part of night in tahajjud I think. He will grant him.
Does that mean Allah will grant you what you need no matter what or is it just like not normal Dua that might be accepted or not.

I've been doing tahajjud most of the nights because I sleep at morning but none of my Dua is getting accepted. I ask for my parents cure or for getting a good position in exam (I do get high marks but not in top 3. I work hard)  or for getting profit from my very little investment recently. But none of that became true.

Now we might say that Allah knows best and it maybe is for a good cause but then what makes tahajjud different from normal Dua. Isn't tahajjud is for to be granted anything."
281,"You guys probably saw the amount of questions I have previously posted on this sub. I started learning a lot more about Islam but personal life makes it extremely hard to pray, even though my parents and siblings are good Muslims.

I had this problem that has been occurring in my family for a year now. Drug problems, hospital visits, mental care, screaming and fighting, my parents can’t catch a break any day. I can’t either. Older sibling problems have been messing up my family. I just can’t do anything as the middle child still in high school. Both parents are on BP medications but My mom has grown a cough from the stress and that cough is the sound of hell. The fighting doesn’t bother me as much as this sound that has been going on since last year. She got a lung scan and chest scan, turns out it’s asthma, but I never want to think about it. Everytime I come to hear it, I pull my hair, hurt myself even tho I’m not suicidal, and even blame Allah for not helping me while I go crazy. My prayers are on and off. The first time I truly felt Muslim was a couple weeks ago, determined to bring a true Muslim. It took hearing those coughs from my mom to start the devilish thoughts in my head. I even committed shirk at one point to help myself.
I pray Quran, my head hurts. I pray salah, I feel like fainting. Which is weird because I go to the gym and am active. I hate showing happiness and faking it to people. I hear those coughs as I’m typing this I hate it. I’m the only one in the family who even cares about it or maybe I’m just too anxious about everything. Any advice? Jazakallah"
282,"Greetings to all. I recently converted to Islam and I'm still unsure of the proper way to greet. 

My mother remarried when I was in highschool. I call my stepfather ""Tito"",  means uncle in my country. But I acknowledge that he is my mother's husband and my stepfather but not my dad. 

Both converted to Islam for more than a decade now.

They work outside the country so I basically grew up without a mother and father by my side. So it's safe to say that I am not close with my stepfather. Now I'm 27, and my mother requested to make a bday greetings to my stepfather. But then she asked me  to call him ""father"" as his request.

I ignored her 3 messages hoping that she will get the hint that I am not comfortable calling him father especially after finding out the insults he spouts with his workmates, my mother, and their friends.

I do not hate him, nor do I love him. But I still respect him as my mother's husband, because he takes care of her.

Now I need help and to ask if it's okay in Islam to force a child to call stepfather/stepmother a ""mom or dad"". Because if I say no, they always use Islam an an argument, guilt trip people to doing what they want. They've done this for years, and since I'm not as knowledgeable in Islam as they are, I end up yielding to their wants."

288,"Assalamu alaykium,

Recent revert here and I still haven't talked to a single Muslim in person about it at all. The main reason why is because I'm intimidated by some of the rhetoric pushed towards Ex-Muslims, Apostasy, and Criticisms towards Islam. While I myself do find it difficult not to outright defend Islam and start having a go at them. I feel like I find it difficult to defend the actions of Muslims as it seems like sometimes we may be overzealous in this regard. Me included.

I am just wondering, is it looked down on to question your faith as a Muslim culturally? Or is it part of the Doctrine? Or is it just the opinion of some Scholars?

I think I'm fairly committed to God but if Islam is False... the main reason I haven't told anyone is because I simply want to leave without any drama. I'm not as committed to Islam as I am to God and if God isn't here then I see no reason to be here.

While that may sound controversial, respectfully, it shouldn't be. As a revert, we are either coming as an Atheist or someone who believes God is here stronger then they do in their own faith.

I just don't want to be stuck pleasing people over pleasing God. As I did not leave my faith for something so superficial.

I don't want people keeping track of whether I'm doing my Salah, whether I show up on Fridays, how I dress, who I associate myself with, how I conduct myself etc.

I'd rather keep it entirely between me and God. I feel as though I'd rather be mistaken for an Agnostic who deeply subscribes to Islam but practices in secret.

I don't want to be called a Kafir because I disagree with some specific Scholar's ruling, or I don't think a particular Hadith makes sense, or I no longer subscribe to particular beliefs as new evidence to the contrary has been presented.

So, I'm just wondering, is it looked down on to question our Faith, question Scholars, and question Islam?

It seems like the consensus objective opinion is that it is fine but I feel like people have more deeply internalized that it isn't and therefore it has bled into Islamic predominant Countries."

297,"Salam, Does it ever happen to a Believer that he misses prayer? 

Does it also occur to him that he misses prayer but prays Tahajjud regularly? meaning he makes up the prayers but misses them in time.

I have heard a lecture of one of our contemporary Scholars, in which he said that ""a night prayer is an invitation from Allah"", and that one does not get into it easily, except Allah wills.

There is also a Hadith that is obviously well known that the line between Kufr and Belief is prayer.

Basing on these two, does the question above happen?

Now I want to know, let's say there is a person that I really care about who is not Muslim but I pray to allah that he turns that person into a Muslim, can this dua then not be good? Like is there a possibility that this person shouldn't become a Muslim? Because after all I am wishing for that person to find the right path and to find Allah and to inshallah escape hellfire and find the real purpose in life. Shouldn't it be good that I am wishing for Allah to change the heart of this person and to open their eyes?"

I have been hiding the fact that I have converted to islam from my parents as they are islamaphobic. I don't think there is any way of convincing them that islam is not as bad they thought, I gave up with that. But for my marriage they will probably look for an arranged marriage soon, the girl will be a Hindu. I am starting to panic as they probably might look for a girl in a year or 2. I did try some dating apps, but the muslim women I meet there drink alcohol and I don't want someone who does and dresses proactively. Is there any ways as a converted Muslim to find muslim women to marry without doing anything haram.

310,"Salaam alaikum,

I’ve been 8 months revert. As you may know from recent posts I am new to Islam. Everytime I worry or ask born practising Muslims with a much better Imaan than myself which I truly envy sometimes because of my home situation not making it ideal for me to practise the basic pillars of Islam. Everytime I worry they tell me “Take it easy” “The Sahaba’s didnt become Muslim overnight.”

What proof is there on this that reverts should take it easy? The Sahaba’s had personal guidance from the Prophet (SAW). 

Cause especially with deviance in our Ummah and fitna these days how should any Muslim take it easy? 

What proof is there from the Quran and Sunnah to back this up?

 And if its true then how long until one becomes truly practising on a average basis?"

We like the name Abdul Rahman and were thinking that we can call him Rahman for short. I then realized, that this is likely not permissible. Do you know if it's okay to use a shorter nickname like Rami (or whatever we come up with), or do we have to call him his complete name, Abdul Rahman every time?

Thanks!"

Let’s be bloody honest,their views are biased. They will do anything in their power to not make their loved ones feel bad. So they are not objective. All i want is a speck of love. Even a little is enough. A single literal compliment could drive me for years. So i ask you my fellow muslim brothers and sisters,why did Allah,the creator of the universe and the things within it,made me this way?

Is it to make me suffer one of the worst things a human psychologically suffer,loneliness?"

Because I’m so hyper-focused on not being aroused, I’m even getting more aroused. This also happens when I’m stressed or when I’m doing something too fast (if that makes sense). Sometimes I just stop washing it because I’m so exhausted of washing. But after that I’m afraid that I did not wash the impurity off and feel kinda depressed. My privat part is also an “outie” so I feel like that when impurity comes out and touches not enough water my whole lower body part becomes impure when the substance reaches my thighs etc.. This is very embarrassing and I know that I sound weird but it literally effected my daily prayers. I feel like my prayers will never be accepted

315,"Salam Brothers and Sisters. I really hope you are all great and prosperous and on a great journey towards God Almighty.

What I am going to say is just a small rant, that isn't ill-boding, rather just to try and give Naseeha(advice).

So I see a lot of questions in this sub about very intricate and  nuanced Fiqhi issues(Jurisprudence). And that is a good thing, as it  shows that people are eager to learn how to worship God the correct way.

The problem is: I see a lot of brothers and sisters answering  randomly to such very intricate questions that need a Faqih(a scholar in  jurisprudence) or an Imam to answer. The questions are usually missing  important information.

For example, a question about using alcohol for curing  hyperpigmentation was answered by a lot that (it's okay unless it's used  as a drink) forgetting the fact that the four schools of thought deem  alcohol as an impurity(like Pigs and Urine) and that this fact will  affect a lot of rulings that connect to that, like buying and selling  impurities being invalid. And rubbing impurity on the skin or handling  it is not allowed. And most of the answers never made sure whether the  questioner really exhausted all other medically proposed stuff by  doctors worldwide. Also, we don't know whether the asker's  hyperpigmentation is actually an illness or just an aesthetic problem  which can be lived with normally.

​

Please understand that the above discussed question is for the sake  of example, and I'm not trying to argue about the ruling now. As I  myself don't know what the four schools say.

​

The solution: I would suggest that brothers and sisters here don't  answer fiqhi questions so lightly as if they won't be asked about it in  the day of reckoning. And that they link to scholars who they trust, or  to Fatwa's of scholars they trust(be it a Salafi or one of the four  schools of thought)

​

Please accept this advice in the shape of a rant and forgive me and pray for me :)"
316,"Hello to whoever reads this. I, am a 14 year old male. My life is quite literally falling apart in front of my own eyes and i do not know what to do. I used to pray the daily prayers do dhikr and go to the masjid but now i dont even know what to do. This is kind of a long story but please help me out. Ever since my grandpa (mothers father) passed away this june everything has gone where is shouldn’t have. We moved houses and ever since we did it have stopped praying my prayers, i used to pray tahajjud right after isha because i couldnt wake up for it and id do dhikr read the quran and i hated this dunya and just chased the aakhira but now it seems as though my life just changed in a second. Ever since we moved houses, this new area net quite stuck well with me i dont know how to explain it but i just don’t know what has drifted me away from the almighty Allah subhanahuwatallah but ever since we moved, i lost all my concentration while praying, stopped my dikhr and quran and just drifted far away from Allah. The masjid in this area is good but i just cant concentrate while praying because of a few reasons which are first of all the imams qrrat is just not good and i just don’t feel the connection with Allah here even though i made dua to move here and now i regret making that dua. My father was never really present in my life and my mother is a great person but she believes in horoscopes which is shirk and i tell her about it but she denies. My father i thogut was a good muslim until recently i found his twitter acount in which he liked and commented on around 1100 posts of porn which is devastating considering the fact that I just found my sisters twitter account as well and it was full of swear and bad words which i dont encourage. I have always been bad in studies but now i feel like i want to end it alll sometimes and just die but i want to do something for my parents and make them proud but i have always failed in mostly everything i do which is sad considering i am a man and need to win but i just fail.

As I am reading Quran, I think I'm in love with all surahs. But there's one that's sticking out to me in particular. I have some favorites like Al kahf, Al anbiya, Al Imran etc but this one specifically makes me scratch my head and go ""wow!?""

Please if anyone is well versed in poetry or Quranic methodology, share with me why this surah's pattern is just so wow??

It's so aesthetically pleasing and abstract in its poetry I can't fathom it. Like the one pattern that scratches my brain the same way is the beginning of surah Al kahf."
322,"I was in a state of ghafla for a long time. Though I was praying, reciting Quran, doing dhikr-- I did so without feeling. I did nothing to build my iman. I spent my free time with entertainment. 

Now I am in hardship from my own doing. I realize I need to turn back to Allah but the commotion of life is leaving me depressed. When I ask for forgiveness, I feel nothing. It makes me feel like a hypocrite. I know my actions have oppressed me. 

Sometimes I wonder, if I am actually sorry or am I just unhappy with my situation now and that's the only reason I am turning to Allah. 

Do I just keep asking Allah to help me feel and get back on the straight path? It feels useless and numb. I feel unmotivated."
323,"I am taking Religious Studies GCSE (England exams) and doing Christianity as one. Now I have to write about the religions of course, for example I'd write ,

""Another belief is thhat God created humans to have stewardship towards other creatures..""

Etc.

Is this shirk in any way?

I always say Christians believe, or claim, or think, or one of their beliefs is. And in the lessons it's not really opinionated it's kind of just ""here's what's Christians believe. here's what some other Christians believe. Here's some skepticisms people have about it."". etc Obviously I don't believe it and we're not expected to at all. It's just learning about the religion objectively. Anyway perhaps silly question, just wanted to clear some doubts."

335,"**The 1st question:**  
today at school I finished at 3:30 and suddenly I heard the adhan for asr but I was a bit far from the mosque so as quick as I could I tried to to reach the mosque and when I got to the mosque I saw 2 men coming out of the toilet where they were doing wudu and they went inside to go pray . When I got to the mosque I did wudu of course and went inside where everyone prays but they haven't finished salat al-jama'ah (congregational prayer) prayer and I saw the 2 man doing wudu following through with the others even though they are late to the prayer. I ignored my confusion and just prayed alone and when everyone finished praying they looked at me weird like why didn't he join us or something close to that. And the question came to my mind is

**Am I supposed to join a Salat al-jama'ah (Congregational Prayer) even when I am late ?**

**The 2nd question:**  
**when are we allowed to fight someone and how far can we take the fight ?**

the first part of the question is definitely clear but what I meant with the second part is, is it haram to take the fight seriously and leave the other person badly injured or does it depend on the reason why the fight has started in the first place (stealing, someone started a fight, etc...) ?  
Also I know such random question to ask but I always find myself in situations as these but I back down since I am not sure if It's okay in Islam to do such thing at the beginning, I always avoid them but someday (hopefully not) I might run into this kind of problem with no way to back down

My name is omar, and I stood there 5 meters away from her after she ran up the sofa and stomped my stomach. Didn't even touch her. All for what? She was pissed that I didn't go shave my beard as her narcissistic family commanded.

This reflects the majority of my family life experience. The two who should be closest and most dear to me, screwing my life up and then turning to others to claim how they're victims, while also shooting down any  attempt of me bettering myself, like getting closer to Allah.

That evil voice in my head telling me to finish them off is so damn tempting. WAllahi I don't know what to do, I've been tormented ever since I was a child and this torment still goes on till this very day. Said I'd endure this until they send me off to another country to study as they promised (this is not done out of caring or wanting the betterment of my life, but to brag about it to their other narcissistic friends/family). Now that I've finished high school, they are literally breaking me to accept and go to a college so close to where they live.

They've also finally got my little sister to turn on me, my little sister that I try and teach to that some things aren't right, like things as simple as throwing trash out of the car. But somehow, my parents disagree, and they'll literally fight me for claiming that. I'm so scared for her future. She's so attached to her mother's side of the family although all they do is mistreat her, I mean for goodness sake her egotistical uncle just before yesterday gave his 12 y/o son (who always tries getting away with bullying her with his other brother) his cigar to pose with and then proceeded to give it to his 4 year old so confidently, that's the type of people we are dealing with here. Parents are also okay with her wearing revealing clothes, I don't want my sister being talked about in a disgusting manner, as I'm a boy and know that these other boys of my generation are nothing but slandering cowards, especially toward immodestly dressed girls.

348,"Aslaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. 

I (m27) was seeing someone who was in another city from me. She (f26) is a revert foreigner (reverted beginning of the year) who is starting her final year at uni. We met since August and managed to meet up twice, with the 2nd meetup being with my sister. I informed some of my family including my dad about her after the 1st meetup as I want nothing to be hidden and there to be barakah. 

She was a recent divorcee who got married this year in February and then got divorced in June, so it was a short marriage. She does wear head covering sometimes, even wore abayah. She does consume pork but only because it was hard to find halal meat in the city where she was staying. Nevertheless, I believe that this is between her and Allah SWT, plus she is a new revert. She mentioned in her previous marriage, she doesn't eat pork and said she won't eat pork if she got married again.
She does make effort to learn Quran and she also attend Islamic lectures almost every weekend to learn more about Islam. Since she lived here in UK, her parents did not know that she was married due to strain relationship between them ever since she left home at a young age. They also did not know that she became a Muslim as they are atheists. 

She recently went back home to her country in September for few weeks to save money as she just recently moved to a new place here in UK. She was staying at her parents' place. However, her parents caught her praying on the first day back and learnt from her that she is a Muslim. Since then, they stopped paying for her tuition fee because they don't want her to go back to UK because of Islam. Nevertheless, she insisted that she will take a gap year from uni and come back to UK next year to finish uni. She is planning to open up her business to support herself financially so that she will not be restricted by her parents. 
She still want to marry me, stating she wishes we could get marry tonight. 

 Since she is adamant to marry me and I do see future with her as well as potential in her that she will be a practicing sister. Initially, when we met, we agreed to move out together when married as I currently live at home with my family. Now, she is suggesting to save cost by moving into my parents' house after marriage as she saw the rent price in London being expensive. 

She suggested me to visit her to meet her parents in her country with my family and then marry her there. I am still deciding whether I should carry on going ahead with this despite the obstacles or call it off as we only known each other for over a month now.

I will be doing isikhara tonight and several days to see whether I should continue this relationship or move on. I also reminded her that I came from a strong Pakistani cultural background and that if staying at my house with my parents, she may run into issue cultural clash that may end up making her feel oppress. Hence why I initially suggested moving out after marriage. I informed her to reflect on that and to let me know tomorrow if she still want to make this work. In the meantime, I would like to know what an outsider perspective think about this. 

Also, plesse feel free to ask me more questions."
349,"I had a tutorial in my final year of college (Religion and History Education) and the person leading the seminar consistently argued that Muslims do not need to be religious to be called Muslim. I recognise that she might have been arguing that Muslims deserve to have their individuality recognised, but it seemed that she was downplaying the religion aspect. As far as I am aware, Muslim means member of the Islamic Faith, so to argue otherwise seems strange to me. Instead, the speaker seemed to reduce Muslim to nothing more than an ethnic group. I am not Muslim myself but would like to be educated on this argument to avoid upsetting anyone in my teaching career."
350,"Salam,

At the current moment I am struggling very badly with suicidal thoughts. The past 3/4 days have been constant, and I just feel horrible about so many things. I have been diagnosed with depression for almost 3 1/2 years, but my parents and I have experienced a huge disconnect on the issue of mental health.

I'm not blameless by any means, but it has been difficult with them. I keep returning to the same mistakes but my mother's attacks have turned personal and despite how much I've been trying to hint to her that it's more than attention-seeking and laziness, she doesn't believe me. But the past few days have been even worse for me, and since my mother has been angry at me for the past two days now, it's only been getting worse.

I am unable to receive any sort of mental health resources or treatment. I'm kind of a shitty Muslim so I don't know if Allah will respond to my duas, so I am requesting if you guys could please make dua on my behalf for me to get better. I'm very scared that if this continues, things may not end as well this time."

Alcohol is very common in my community as I am Hispanic and we see alcohol as a common thing in our lives. I look for any advice or anything at this point I can see myself falling into the wrong path and I’m worried.
357,"My dad has many kids from different women. He is currently with my mom and had 4 kids with her, including me. My dad is a narcissist who likes to be praised and lacks emotional empathy. The only time we talk is when I do something for him. I have a dad, but I don't have a dad, if you know what I mean?

Two years ago, he got into a physical fight with my mom, and I came in to stop the fight. My brother, who is now 19, also came to help break up the fight. My dad got so violent that he punched my brother, which led me to hit him back and put him in a chokehold to prevent him from doing anything. Wallahi, I know I was wrong and asked for forgiveness. He manipulated my family back home and lied about the situation. He called me a bad son, and we had to get on our knees to apologize in front of him. His family doesn't really like my mom, so they believed his lies


The reason they fought is that my dad started accusing my mom of cheating because my mom confronted him. He threatened to rip her passport, and the next thing you know, they started fighting. I've never had a good relationship with him; I've craved his affection sometimes. Sometimes he is happy and starts making jokes, and the next day he's angry and insults us. This has become basically normal to the point where we don't believe him when he is all happy and bubbly.

Yesterday, my mom caught him cheating again. Well, my mom and I already knew, but she wants to stay for the sake of us, and she fears what people will say back home and what her family will think of her. It's important to add that both of my parents are Christians, and I'm the only Muslim

I've endured a lot of emotional abuse, which has led to anger towards him, especially because my mom works tirelessly, often waking up early in the morning. He hasn't bought her anything expensive; instead, he used her hard-earned money to buy a watch and some jewelry for the woman he is cheating on her with. They sometimes fight because my dad blames my mom for taking money or starts an argument for no reason. My mom doesn't buy nice clothes for herself or expensive things. So, my question is, is it permissible to cut ties with my dad?"
358,"Salam everyone.  I have recently said the shahada and accepted Allah as the one God and Muhammad as his prophet.  I was born into a Christian family and raised in a Christian church until I was an adult.  

My questions are:  is it inappropriate for me, a white man with tattoos down to my wrists and ankle to enter a mosque and pray with the others there?  Should I cover them?  Uncovered ok?  

Also, as I am new to Islam I am still learning Salah and I use my cell phone as a resource to read from and guide me through the postures.  Would I want to wait until I have memorized all the prayers before I go to a mosque, or could I still go and pray but maybe just pray quietly or in heart along with the others?  

Sometimes I make small mistakes in my salah and don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable or be disrespectful.  

Thank you ahead of time for your help and salam alaykum."

365,"Good day all, I'm based in Poland and I own multiple international preschools I want to open a catering service to cater to these preschools. One large thing I see missing is catering which provides halal meat about 10-15% of my students are Muslim and I would like to provide them the option of Halal meat. I can source Halal meat easily enough but I would like to be able to prepare it in my kitchen which would primarily be staffed by non-Muslim Polish workers.

367,"I read and hear alot about how one should control their anger. Now, what does Islam say about a person who lies, blames, confuses a person, due to their wealth think they have entitlement over others, wrongly use islam to justify their wrong behaviour, think it is okay to make others suffer as long as they keep their parents and family happy, takes advantage of vulnerable people and their problems to then later use against them and make them feel inferior and humiliates them and doesn't admit they are wrong or apologise etc. 

A person like this prays, gives charity, controls their anger, seems patient, controls their tongue, etc. 

When people explain what they are doing is wrong, they ignore, be silent, don't explain or answer but expect people to be good to them and listen or instead they tell the people they have hurt that they are not good muslims for not being able to control their anger and tongue. Leaving people feeling like they have disappointed ALLAH? 

Now one feels bad for ill treatment as well as worried that they have been impatient and lacked control over their anger."
368,"Assalamualaikum brothers and sisters

One of my family members has suffered from illness where his blood pressure was high and blood sugar was low 

He works as a property sales person and travels various places to see land and house

This has made his family think he is affected by Black magic because he travels such and such places for business

I don't think it's true and it's a genuine medical reason for his illness because he is obese and his eating habits are not good

But if someone is really affected by Black magic or jinn what are the signs that person shows

369,"I'm a non-Muslim author. I've read several books on Islam, but there really is no substitute for talking to real Muslims.

Is there anything about this character that is wrong/objectionable:

1. She's a rather pious Muslim woman in her 50s who wears hijab and traditional clothing. She's not perfect 100% of the time, but when she's not, I want to address it in the narrative rather than introducing a plothole like, ""Why didn't she consider that, given her faith?""

2. She's a medical doctor who treats both male and female patients. She doesn't touch or look at the bodies of either sex except for medical necessity to save lives. (In my limited research, I haven't determined if this acceptable or taboo. Please enlighten me.)

3. She is a surrogate mother of sorts to an unmarried, atheist man in his 20s whose parents are deceased. They do not live together, but she looks after him as a mother would, and the two share hugs and pray together. He is atheist, and she knows, but he agrees to pray to make her feel better in bad situations. (Are the hugs specifically a problem?)

4. Is it haram for her to serve alcohol to non-Muslim friends even if she herself is not drinking?

5. How do Muslims view the idea of space aliens, undiscovered monsters, and the like? Just another part of God's creation?"

I don't deserve any fullfilment and I am sure Allah thinks so too. I don't blame god but I am just too weak as always. I am far past my breaking point, yet mentally I am tortured and I really can't handle it. I won't kill myself but I truly believe there is no hope for a better life for me. No matter how much I try, I am never good enough. I am a failure and I have failed in life. I just can't handle the emotional torture of my feelings and past. I am truly alone. My wish is to be erased from excistence. This all is just dumping my thoughts without a clear reason of why, as I know I am too tired to do anything. I can't be with my thoughts and my emotions overwhelm me constantly. Everytime I try to get help I get misused. I really can't handle it anymore.

396,"Hello, I’ve found myself in a situation where I’m not sure if I should just leave it alone or make duaa. So a few months ago, I started talking to this guy. I prayed Istikhara for him and he appeared in my dream twice, and I kept seeing him more around school. One of the dreams consisted of me telling him I prayed Istikhara for him and he seemed very happy. Unfortunately, it didn’t really go anywhere, but we later discussed that it didn’t work out due to miscommunication. A few months later we started talking and we both discussed our future with each other. Not long after, he decided it was best to cut it off because he wanted to focus on school, etc. And he’s been in all my dreams ever since. I was wondering if I should pray Istikhara again, or should I let him come back to me. Also, when I prayed Istikhara I thought my dreams were clear signs he was meant for me, but maybe I read them wrong?

I’m not sure if this means anything, but we also talked us having the same dream about marrying each other the same night."

399,"I’m not getting married yet I haven’t even found my written spouse yet but when the time comes inshallah I want to have a VERY small Nikkah meaning no friends and only immediate family. 

My best friend is Muslim so she should understand if she wasn’t invited but would it still be rude somehow? Part of me would possibly feel bad but at the same time I’m so scared of evil eye (not that I believe she will evil eye me) so that’s why I want to keep it to immediate family only. 

I’ve been working on becoming a private person as I have always been an over sharer and I’ve been doing well alhamdulilah but before this change my best friend and I always used to tell every single detail of our lives to eachother and I’ve changed so much and am so comfortable with being private I even considered not even telling anyone I’m married (besides my immediate family of course) unless I’m directly asked which if I followed through with that would mean my best friend wouldn’t even know (unless she suspected/asked). Am I islamically being a bit too much or is my reasoning behind this understandable and fine?

For the sake of Allah I want to complete half of my deen with peace and as much bakarah as possible and I’ve seen the outcomes of marriages with too many people involved whether it’s attending the Nikkah/wedding or getting involved in the couples business etc. I really don’t want that because I feel as though things like that can be the biggest distraction when both my future husband and I should solely be focused on our deen and teaching our future children about Islam rather than worrying about what people are saying (backbiting) and having it effect our marriage. 

Please reply with Islamic knowledge and not just emotions JazakAllah"

At this point, you're so down, you're so delirious that you just believe that whatever you're going through has basically just promised Jannah for you (Then you realize how stupid you sound).
So you go to pray, you make Dua, but the thing is: You don't know what to ask for. You have so many severe problems in your life, you can't even describe them. Each problem needs its own cure, but since you can't even describe the problem, you can't even get the proper prescriptions, you can't go to the Pharmacy (Allah) and get the exact medicine you need.
So you're just on your knees, hands up, and the only thing you can say to Allah is ""Just get me out of here and give me something good."" But then you remember you need to be precise and detailed in your Dua, that you need to pour you're heart out to Him, but at the point you don't have a heart to pour out because of how much you've gone through.

410,"Asalam Alaikum everyone.  
I first have to express my feelings of how grateful i am to be a muslim and that Allah had chosen me for his religion, Alhamdulilah.  
I wanted to go off in this post about people who have yet to understand how beautiful islam is and/or are misguided and lied upon and have built up hatred for it. Mostly ill talk about the latter part.  


I have been a muslim for more than a decade and im excluding childhood as they don't count. I have learned alot about islam, theology and comparative religion by many contemprary scholars and public debates. I have grown to know more about islam. Especially when it comes to the ""islam's enemies"" whom would provide alot of talking points that a common muslim won't know about.  
Its a common tactic they use to try to lie to muslims and make them confused. Thankfully the more i learn about islam and the more i study hadith the more i see the beauty of islam. And of course i try to be as transparent as possible and not a blind mindless sheep that believes just for the sake of it.  


I see that alot of these ex muslims and atheists would find a random hadith narration and dont even bother to study or even try to find out what it even means and come up with their own assumptions as if they are authorised to judge hadith in the first place. Its embarrasing. The amount of people that i see online that are so deceived and blind is baffling.  


I have tried debating so many people about islam and misconceptions, but after so many of them i more and more relate with verses of the Quran when Allah says that he had sealed their hearts. Truly alot of individuals have their hearts sealed and you can clearly see this. And it seriously saddens me. How can man be so deceived by the shaytan and not realize it. May Allah bring them back to the path and have them reflect.  


I suggest people who debate online. Don't bother. I today myself will stop debating online as it has seriously deteriorated my brain cells and only caused discomfort rather than trying to find a common ground. You cant reason with people who cant listen. Its easy to tell if a person is truthful and who isnt.  


The amount of ex muslims in reddit, or twitter spreading so many lies of course to a muslim like me angers me and a part of me wants to give them refutations for every claim but they are endless and their followers are endless. and even if you refute, no one listens. Such a bad state to be in. Not for me but for them. They seem to have no hope for salvation, but i can only hope for Allah to guide them.  
Yet they continue to lie to more and more people and moe and more people could eventually end up in jahannam because of them. May Allah protect us and guide us and make us better and stronger muslims in these challenging times.  


Id like to know about you how is your experience with debates and people who want to debate islam but not willing to learn."

413,"Saalam all, 
I hope this thread finds you all well. I’ve been thinking a lot about my life and just how things are. Recently, I’ve been going through a lot of changes and especially got into praying to praying tahajjud during Ramadan and I’ve been trying to keep it off. I will not lie. It has been a little hard for me because I have been so busy back-and-forth with everything going on in my life from my family to my personal health. But every time I pray, I feel very enlightened I recently I know I have not been able to pray tahajjud, but I just feel this pull to ensuring that I try to pray and speak to Allah a little bit. I feel guilty that I haven’t been able to speak to Allah and expressed my appreciation for what I have here, but also my concerns on life. I’ve just been so curious, what’s drawn me to ensure I make this prayer and I make tons of dua and remember Allah. I know I’ve lost a lot of things last year, but I gain so many things that I never thought possible. I used to complain about everything and kill myself over the smallest of mistakes but now I try to take it easy one day at a time and realize that this is all a process. My parents have always been on me about playing and when I was younger, I used to be very lackadaisical about it like most kids probably who don’t see beyond their noses.

 Is this mean growing up and become closer to my faith? I feel so much peace when I speak to Allah and those hours by which one prays tahajjud is the most peaceful."

Just be grateful when someone gives you anything. To me 13 dollars a lot and you can buy a meal for your family with that amount. To anyone struggling don't ask for more when a good amount is already given.

420,"assalamalaikum everyone, does anyone have any reccomendations for islamic books to learn islam? i’m more concerned with the politics and history after islam was established in Makkah, such as how different branches emerged and how islam spread to different parts of the world."
421,"First off I read alot about people's experience where they presumably get kidnapped by aliens and it's very similar to people that are possesed by djins.
Both have sleep paralysis, both dream about animals attacking them in their sleep, both have marks on their body that they and doctors cant explain,...
I think there is definitely a possibility that aliens are actually just djins but there is one part that makes me unsure.
In the Quran Allah swt states that there are beings above and beneath humans. Now we know that the djin are beneath humans since shaytan had to bow down to Adam as, and it's often stated djins are very stubborn and act like little kids showing mankids superiority in intelligence. And than u have the angels. My only proof I could find that they are beneath humans is that they have no free will and can't sin meanwhile Allah swt said that if mankind would never sin he would wipe them out and create a new mankind since sinning and than repenting is better than just not sinning, this shows how Allah swt has a greater plan for us. But than what creature is above us? I think these might be aliens. So yeah that's all"
423,"Okay, this isn’t really a question. I’m more in need of advice. I frequently get videos on tiktok and sometimes reddit about women in Afghanistan and how ‘free’ they were before, and always in the comments there are people who blame islam for he condition it has placed some women in today. I know that a lot of it is cherrypicked and purposefully twisted to push an agenda, but seeing people act so hatefully towards islam really saddens me. Their proof are grossly misinterpreted verses and Hadith taken out of context (i have studied all their sources and the context behind them) I know it’s nothing i should concern myself with and i do try to say i’m not interested in these videos but they return anyway and I don’t know how to maybe try to educate them?

Frequently, they will also mention how here is no successful muslim country (which is objectively false) and forget how it was under constant war and forget about the islamic golden age.

424,"Assalamualaikum, I am a western revert, and I am quite new to islam. I read quran, and I've done my research. I am still learning, and many things are still completely new to me. As such, I don't do or know everything perfectly yet, but I know that over time this will progress. 
I would like to go to mosque and get Accostumed to going there on the regular, and maybe find some people that could help and teach me more about islam, and everything involved. 
The problem is, I'm a foreigner in this country. I'm from the Netherlands, living in Indonesia. I'm still learning the language, but only know a few phrases and words. In general, my experience is that indonesians don't speak any English at all, and I won't be able to communicate with them, unless I try to use broken bahasa Indonesia. How does one go about going to the mosque for the first time in a country where you don't speak the local language? Any tips would be appreciated."
426,"Thank you everyone for replying im going to go with the hanafi ruling (I use hanafi and always have) that says its its permissible because this family are not religious and are having this meal because of Polish tradition where they abstain from flesh other than fish untill the 25th so on the 24th when I would be visiting them there is a halal feast
these people are interested in islam and do not want to push any of the Christianity that they strongly denounce onto me and they treat my faith with respect and even reverence. They have already accepted my invitation to join me for Eid where I will make them an amazing feast of both various muslim cultures eid stuff and Scottish + german food."
427,"Salam dear brothers and sisters,

So i have been using this sub for a while now. And i have noticed that we have scammers lurking here. So this how it works. You will get a message request from a relatively new account or an account with very less activity. They will do salam and ask how are you and stuff. And they will mention that they are doing good. And then they share their story. It will always be a starving family. An elder brother taking care of things alone. No money to eat and need rice or wheat. 

They have different stories. If you ask them for proof then they will indeed show you proof. Yes they are from Africa and they can even show you fresh pictures. But if you activate your inner detective you will know the truth. 

Nonetheless don't fall for it. They have been doing this here on reddit for quite some time. And they are still doing it because some people indeed fall for it. I myself received more than 5 such messages. So yeah, be careful."

429,"Basically, my ex mate (ill call her Xeno to make it easier), was texted by my 7 yr old sister and she started calling her a r**ard and swore at her. Then i unblocked Xeno and confronted her about it, calling her a p*do for swearing at my 7 year old sister (i regret it now, may Allah forgive me), afterwards i told her mate (ill call her Alice) about what happened saying stuff like ""Xeno is a p*do"", she did this and that"". Now, i have deleted those messages that i sent to Xeno and Alice however i am not sure if i had backbit or gossiped, im really worried and need answers or help. If i did backbite, i cant apologise because me and Xeno arent on good terms and they wont care and wont accept my apology or forgive me. I know i can say a dua for forgiveness for backbiting, but i would just like to know this.

 Did I backbite? And if i did, can anyone who sees this and/or replies make dua for Allah to forgive me? My name is Malek if that is needed for your dua to help me."

https://reddit.com/r/islam/s/S0t54F0SH3

Read it for context.

now due to all of that..is it okay if I start praying just one prayer a day? Maybe Fajr everyday and then slowly introduce Isha..and then slowly each of the other three over the course of a few months or so?

I don’t think I can cope up with suddenly starting to pray everything and also hide it from my family..it will be very very hard for me."

434,"I'm young. Been married just 1.5 years. I had a relatively good 1.5 years with my spouse, where I ignored almost all the things that bothered me, overworked myself, and tried to look on the bright side. Tried to make it work. Gave in. 

I'm by no means a great muslim. I pray. I fast. I do zakat and sadqah, but I'm pretty basic and that's just something I've always wanted to work towards (even when I drift towards my own desires instead). 

I married someone I looked up to religiously - thought was better than me. Turns out, she just has double standards. Has no problem lying to me, disrespecting me, physically abusing me (i'm much stronger so I never fight back), but.. would 'portray' a more religious image. 

And, with what I've learned in the past few months - I'm pretty much done with all my 'couple' goals and have given up on most things. I don't want anything with her. We don't have to get separated cos it's extra work, but I don't look forward to intimacy, don't have anything to talk about, her breath smells bad, and everything is just.. pale?

I don't wanna remarry, so not really thinking about separation. Any brothers who 'co-exist' with their roommates and have some advise for me?"
435,"i see people still using this app when their misguidance is clear as day.

 Muzmatch's instagram account pretty resoundingly increments the company as a spreader of unislamic  feminist concepts  and outright corruption . In one clip a muslim woman featured with captions that give what her expections are in marriage including ""i don't have to cook for you"",""i don't have to clean for you"" and ""I don't have to have sex with you if I don't want to"".OK let's leave the cooking and cleaning aside but the whole point of marriage is the legalisation of the access to sexual intercourse. In arabic nikah literally means sexual intercourse and islam has taught us sexual intimacy is only halal when whole host of other conditions are met that constitute what we know today as marriage i.e mahr, commitement,provision,qawwama,loyalty and so on. 

RasulAllah s.a.w told us  these are the conditions that make her and your private parts permissible for each other . So for saying ""i don't have to have sex with my husband if I don't feel like it"" is like trying to putting in the contract your right to breach the contract without somehow  that nullifying that agreement. No,that's invalid stipulation that would render the contract null and void . The whole contract is entered into to legalize access to sexual intimacy.The woman is agreeing in principle in granting his husband unrestricted sexual access to her.He is then bound by multitude of obligations both specifically as a husband and generally as a muslim i.e he has to take care of her ,he has to treat her kindly , he has to treat her honourably ,he has to protect her and he can not harm her meaning that obviously that there is a valid reason for her to decline sexual intercourse with him such as being sick or what not then he has to respect that but just ""I am not in the mood"" is not a valid reason ,he might not be in the mood to work 8 or 9 hours a day and handover all his earnings to provide for you but he has to do it anyway because that's the deal.  


Muzmatch is promoting unislamic feminist ideology that contradicts islamic values and principles .In other clips in their ig account , they have a muslim woman talking about whether or not a man should pay for the first date and in other clips it makes explicitly clear that this company regards its products as a dating app not a matrimonial app .They are in the business of finding muslims boyfriends and girlfriends . It's the muslim tinder, so given that it's not surprising that you find people who use the app holding views about marriage that make them inallegiable for marriage.These are the kinds of people who noone would marry but someone might date, which means obviously that user of this app are muslims who date.These are not the pool of people that any serious muslim who genuinely interested in marriage will look to find a spouse and it doesn't represent that type of muslim. 

Feminism is just like redpill. It wants woman to be vulnerable and unprotected .For feminists, they mislead woman into thinking that go through life without a qawwam and that they can stand toe to toe with men.This just sets them up for ruin and exploitation  and redpill wants woman to be treated on same standard as man basically calling feminists on their bluff which also  sets woman up for exploitation and ruin . muzmatch has one video of a muslim woman with a billie eilish styled hijab saying that it's a green flag for her in looking for her husband if the man says that he is a feminist so it's explicitly clear  that muzmatch is endorsing an ideology that sets woman up for victimization not for marriage and safety and protection of husband's qawwama. It's also clear that muzmatch must have some sort of affiliate marketing program whereby a user can earn commisions of how many people that they can refer to join  the app  which immediately calls into question any and all endorsements that they use  and the character of those who do it .

They are making money by promoting relationships and ideas that islam doesn't sanction and that will lead to unislamic ends . So if you're on this app , it would be advised to get off of it and if you're marketing this app ,it is advised to stop .Any marriages that do come about through this app , it is predicted to just end up contributing to an increase in divorce rates within the muslim community

I was born into a Muslim family. I am a Muslim… I wear a hijab and I do think I believe in God. But I just don’t care about anything. I don’t feel anything. I feel nothing inside anymore. I’m not sure if anything I do even matters. Everything has lost its meaning to me. Every aspect of life feels like such a drag. I stoped enjoying social events and gatherings it all just seems like a waste of time. Life has become so difficult, everyday I wake up more apathetic than the day before. I use to be so cheerful and full of light. I had so much joy inside me… but not anymore. How can I see purpose in life again? How can I see the beauty of life again?"
438,"Please forgive any ignorance. I am not a Muslim, but an avid reader of science fiction. 

One of the things I do know about Islam is the practice of facing Mecca during prayers. 

How would one go about this from space? Would the solution change for different distances from Earth? (Earth orbit, different planets in the solar system, different galaxies entirely, etc.) Or even from a different dimensions? (Ex. Warp travel in warhammer 40k) How about if Earth cannot be located from your position? 

The only mention of this that I can remember from any piece of science fiction is is the Old Man’s War by John Scalzi. The question is brought up once and never addressed again. 

Thank you all in advance!"
439,"Salaam, 

As the title says, i'm very eager to revert as a muslim and i am actually married with a ""non-praticant"" christian girl and we also have a baby. The question is, can i become a muslim and further do a halal marriage with her to turn the things legal and halal? She's supporting me a lot in becoming a muslim, in fact most of my interest in islam and arab culture came from her, she is a enthusiast of arab culture. I told her today about my decision to revert and told also the conditions that she have to accept, like our future sons being raised as muslims, the halal marriage, my eat and drink restrictions and etc e and she's ok about all of these things. So, is it ok to stay with her and our kid? Please, be kind in your responses, i will be very grateful to all of you. Thank you!"

I didn't know where to find recommendations so I came here. The books can be a compilation of all prophets or it can be a single book dedicated to telling the story of a single prophet. thank you 😊"

444,"Assalamu Alaykum, 
I'm a 25 yo female, turning 26 soon. I had a harsh childhood which involved being beaten alot by my dad and also at the age of 12 being  s/aed by my dad's father. I posted here before about my relationship with my father, and that has not improved.  Because of my SA history, I  absolutely refuse to marry a man I'm not fully, and completely in love with. I need to know them at their core. I need to know they're a good person and not hiding themselves behind a mask before marriage, which is very difficult for us Muslims, however I think I succeeded in finding someone. Before this, my dad tried to introduce me to a man who he knew. This man was not honest with his intentions (a US passport)  but I saw right through him. My dad also warned me to never tell any men interested about my SA for as long as I live. This really upset me as it is something I struggled with for very long and saw that my marriage would not be honest. 

Anyways, back to the story, me and the man I love met online in a video game. He lives in another state, and was not a Muslim.  We got to know eachother very well and fell in love. He came to see me and met my family.  One time he visited and asked to go to the mosque with my brother, and he converted. He also asked me personally if I would like to marry him. I said yes, and he tried to meet my dad. My dad hated him from the start and was so rude to him, saying he was probably a Trump supporter and a republican (because he's from a southern state) and ever since he's been weary of my dad. My dad told me he refuses me marrying him because this man could just change his mind about being Muslim and my marriage would become Haram. I told him the moment I found out my husband left Islam I would obviously leave, as I am an adult woman who can make up my own mind. 

I spoke to a sheikh with a full story about my dad and the abuses, and about the man. He said my father has no reason to reject the marriage. He informed me in certain cases I can have a sheikh marry us without my dad being present, but ofcourse I feel sad and know this will cause alot of backlash. My parents have been divorced for years. (My dad  has gotten married and divorced around 5 times as he's very difficult with everyone around him.) I have a brother one year younger. My mom adores the man and thinks he's very polite. 

The man said he would like to try again, and will come in Febuary to seek my father's approval, and right away we can get a katab kitab , like a legal marriage so we can prepare for our main wedding. He's struggling to learn in his small town alone how to pray and memorize Quran, but he is learning some Arabic and halal and haram, pillars of Islam and Iman etc. He would very much like to learn to pray with my and my brother's help. He is a very stand up man. I really would like my father to approve this marriage.  How can I prepare for what I see as now the final boss battle? I really want to marry this man and know if I can't marry him, I probably won't ever be able to get married. I was told no man would want me after my SA, and I can't physically give my heart to just any man. I already gave it to this one."
445,"So I recently hypothesised that the duas that i would make would never be what is the best possible for me even though i would think its the best that could happen. Since what ever id make dua of would be of no match to what Allah has planned for me. Therefore my duas started to turn into me saying that Allah please give me enough strength and will and brain to be able to successfully execute your plan for me. And whatever happens next may be what you had planned for. Cause i thoght thatd be smarter.   


So all this really shortened my duas although there were still a couple of other things id make dua for but in general id started to get really short. 

Although i understand that duas can change whats written for me but am i really that wise to know whats best for me in all cases. 

Would really appreciate if someone were to able to clear my clarify my thinking "
446,"Like honestly guys use your damn minds, remember that there were people in the prophet’s PBRUH time that thought judgement day is like 50 years close. Now keep in mind that he lived at 500 AD, look at us now, 1500 years later. We’re all living fine with no solar system problems. If anything the only we can create a judgement day is if world leaders start punting each other with nuclear weapons. 

NASA literally said (with all their technological advancements) that in atleast a thousand years will an asteroid hit the world.

There was many, many, and I recall many cases when people thought the world would end, from 3000 BC to the 1900s (world wars), yet humanity still prospered. Like honestly guys can you stop using the judgement day excuse and start researching.

I’m sorry if I came off as rude but I just wanted to let this out of my chest"
447,"If you go to YouTube and search for stories of Islamic prophets you will find very long lectures in various languages detailing the childhood and adulthood and several events that happened to that prophet. In the Quran the detail is very limited (in fact I don't think anyone can understand what's being talked about unless they have context of other prophets).

In the Hadith there is also little information.

Am I missing something? 

Basically I'm asking about the sources of information of the lives of prophets before Muhammad

Thanks"
448,"hello, I have been having thoughts about converting to Islam. I have researched  about it and I have read all the miracles of the Quran, read so many articles on why islam is the truth and why it isn't the truth. two nights ago I took my shahada by myself (I had no witnesses) and immediately regretted it, it just felt wrong yk? but I started praying, the next day and I just felt like an imposter. I have no idea what is the truth and what is not as well as to convert to islam would be a extremely hard process (which if I did convert fully I would be happy to make those sacrifices). I am just very confused about everything as well as the fact that I sin and feel like a hypocrite. Converting almost feels like a betrayal to myself. Any guidance on this issue would be wonderful, "

maybe this is a dumb question I'm not sure but yk when I see people saying *""recite this surah for depression, this for happiness...""* etc. 

but do I just have to open the surah and read it? or do I need to make like an intention, say bismillah, raise hands or so?

when I do my salah, at the end of it, I say bismillah raise my hands and ask Allah for the things i want and say ameen. Is this a correct way?"

But the only response of Abraham’s people was to say: “Kill him or burn him!” But Allah saved him from the fire. Surely in this are signs for people who believe.

He said ˹to his people˺, “You have taken idols ˹for worship˺ instead of Allah, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!”

So Lot believed in him. And Abraham said, “I am emigrating ˹in obedience˺ to my Lord. He ˹alone˺ is indeed the Almighty, All-Wise.”

We blessed him with Isaac and ˹later˺ Jacob, and reserved prophethood and revelation for his descendants. We gave him his reward in this life, and in the Hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous."

But, obviously there comes a time when people ask me and I can’t share the exact/truth. So, I lie about it, just to escape from that discussion. I know it’s a big sin and I repent right away. I scold myself for that habit. Then I find ways to share the right information with people I lied to, that is where I disappoint people and I lose friends in return.

461,"I really cannot see a life where it gets better. I want to make my parents happy but for what they will die eventually so what's the point. I believe in God, I believe there might be smth for me after this life if I keep praying and doing well by my religion. But it's impossible how much hardship and pain I'm going throught and I don't see it getting any better. I really don't know when was the last time I had peace of mind, people are nice to me people are kind to me but I still feel like shit everyday, I am always anxious and longing for the past, my head hurts 50 percent of the time. The only time I feel comfortable is asleep. I am not gonna end my life or anth but I feel like I'm one mishap away from just accepting that life is shit. People have adviced me. I feel hopeless and tired. I feel like I don't have the motivation to work hard and it's never going to come. I don't even want to work hard. I am lost . I am losing it. I feel like shit. every day. maybe I'll get distracted by something for a while but then as soon as my head works again it's over and my day returns to shit. I don't know anymore. As I said I am not going to do abth pain wise to myself just because I can't. I talk to people. I really want to send this to my mom but it will make her worry so much considering I'm so far away, I really don't know. I really don't. Anxiousness about the future is something I deal with every minute of every day. I cannot live in the present I am either reminiscing about the past or being piss scared about what's to come. Maybe I'm too anxious about a test result but at the same time, I feel like it's not going to get any better even if I pass it. I really don't know. Life is hard, the hardships don't make the good moments better it is never worth it. I am seriously done. I feel like it's not right that most of my life is spent in hardship, I feel like it's not right that I'm unhappy more times than I am happy. I feel like it's not right that people worse than me, and I mean objectively worse than me, can be so easy going. I really love my parents they're my everything and I don't know I feel like shit. Overcoming hardship is a relief. That's it.  A short dopamine kick. Then it's back to shithouse.Even if I do work out with everything and manage to give my parents a good life, what happens after they die? I will have no purpose , I don't even have a purpose now. I am just a cry baby. I don't wanna cry and complain. I hate it. I want to be a man. I don't care if it's toxic. I just don't want to cry and bitch.
My parents have loved me and gave me everything, is it because it looks like I'm about to fail at giving them back that I feel like shit, my siblings will do and have done so much for my sake, I shouldn't feel like this but I do. and by feeling like this im alr a burden to them. even if they want to deny it. it's a loop. that seems like I'm gonna be in forever. I don't get it . I really don't. I have friends but I still feel like shit. I shouldn't feel like this

1) The first one is about explaining happiness or contents (yes there are a few videos on this) but specifically he talks about the ranking of it and the level of extremes people go to e.g. on the lines of: ""as you go higher in the ranking it gets harder and harder to achieve for exmaple a person can play video games or watch a video until his brain turns to mush and he will be happy/content, or a persons meaning of life would be tied to money and notice as we go higher it gets harder and harder to feel happy, the next level is chasing women etc... but at the end of it all they still feel this only momentarily and it is not long lasting that Islam offers so life its about chasing happiness or Dunya its about tranquillity"".

2) The second video will be harder to find and there are many similar one where he specifically described how men and women are described in the Quran with women being described as ""forts"" and the context of marrage how to find the right partner."

469,"For example, a non-Islamic marriage process in the West involves a huge wedding ceremony with friends and family of both sides, not seeing the bride/groom a little before the ceremony, afterwards there is the honeymoon to somewhere nice possibly another country, etc. I have in mind more Christian styled weddings. In what ways are an islamic marriage ceremony (before, during, and after) different? Not just in islamic countries but also in western countries."

Salam Alaikum everyone, thrilled to have discovered reddit couple months ago, I am already changing alot hearing more from Muslims in the west on this sub. Jazakum Allah khair!

My question, I am a 4th year phd student who does the basics in islam, prayer, zakat, and service to my community and beyond. This is obviously not enough, my prayer is sadly void of khushou3, I do serve others wholeheartedly but I don’t do it out of a strong islamic niyya, it comes naturally and doesn’t feel so right to me. I don’t know enough about Islam as much as I would be able to tell some one about it and defend it when people raise questions..

I have put alot of time into my studies and research, and have not been putting effort into my deen and renewing my spiritual connection to Allah since I started grad school. I had a very strong connection to Allah in times of hardship and when I was back home.

And here I am asking your help, what is your recipe for renewing your faith and gaining a stronger foundations. Any resources, online groups, experiences and advice are very helpful. 

Jazakum Allah khair!"

476,"Just a year ago I have started taking the religion seriously. My mom won’t let me fast when she doesn’t have food cooked and she won’t let me make my own food and eat it (I only know how to make small dishes). If I try hiding the fast from her she will know because she gives me breakfast, and I can’t fast on most weekdays because I have things to do with a lot of physical activity in school (but it ends soon). Some of my missed fasts are also from Ramadans before, so is it even still possible for me to make those up? If it has to come to it is it ok to disobey her? Sorry if this post is messy."

478,"Hi, I feel like I’m in a pretty unique situation here. I reverted to Islam a little over a week ago now (female). I’m a senior in high school and have been a competitive swimmer from 9-11th grade. It’s absolutely my favorite sport and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else, which is why I’m having so much trouble. I don’t want to quit the team, but I can’t figure out how to get around having at least something covering my body and not ruining my times. I also run the problem of my family not knowing about all this, and if they did, they most likely wouldn’t support it. It’s my senior year, and I really don’t wanna miss out on participating in the team, but Im at a loss for what I should do."

Like just random things. I cry everytime and I have a 5 month old to take care of. Right now I am at my parents house because they went for umrah and I am just so alone. I literally feel like I can't survive with these thoughts in my head. I am going through hell. I ask Allah for help everytime. I love my daughter so much and I am only trying to be as strong as I can for her.

485," Surat Ar-Rahman (55:13)  ""Which of your lords favours will you both (Humans and Jinn) deny?""

Allah has allowed you to be a Muslim He has given you a chance at attaining Jannat, is that not enough that Allah chosen you to worship Him....chosen you to receive His guidance ......chosen YOU to be part of the chosen ummah...... Allah Hu Akbar. He could have left us Muslims astray but yet after all the sins we commit He has blessed us with His mercy by giving us guidance.

If we have the guidance then we have everything, the guidance of Allah is worth more than this world a million times over infact you can not put a value on it, we are so so so so so blessed to have His guidance.

Having good looks, wealth, status and all the materlisms in this dunya mean nothing absolutely zilch, nada, zerooooo.

WE HAVE THE GUIDANCE OF THE ALMIGHTY......La hawla wala quwwata illa billah.

Keep your head up my fellow Muslims, we are the most blessed people. Allah loves YOU."
486,"my mental health hasn’t been the best lately, there were two deaths in my family in the last two weeks and along with that my grandma has been extremely unwell. 
i have cies in ten days and that just immensely adds on to my stress and anxiety. it wouldnt be this hard if my parents werent always burdening us with their problems. 
when we were coming back from the funeral, they fought and its a two hour drive back home and i kid you not when i say i counted every second back home to calm myself down and prevent an anxiety attack cause i really couldn’t breathe properly and couldn’t stop them from arguing that loud. jus wanted to get off the car. im feeling so low and mentally drained. 

now we’re back home, i wasnt feeling well so i went to the lounge to lay on the couch and be alone. fast forward 15 mins, i come back to my room and pick up my phone and see a shitload of notifications. 
some from my dad, some from both of my sisters separately, some in my sisters group, some in the family group and some in the group we have separately with our dad. my sisters texting me to reply again and again bcs they cant get on the same page as each other on what to do abt the situation, and as usual they need me to be the mediator and help them be on the same page, my dad asking us to make our mom understand and fix their fight. 
all of this made me feel like d…ing 
im so tired of this, this has been happening since forever 

i had to withdraw from two subjects in may june too because they had fucked up my mental health as two weeks before my cies they were on the verge of a divorce, and we (me and my sisters) were being sent back and forth from our place to my grandmas place in attempt of getting our mom back home. and when we’d fail, we’d come back home and listen to our father rant for hours and ask us about whaat he should do. 

theres no end to this,  if there was i would continue helping them as i have done for all these years but now i cannot take it!!
my mental health is deteriorating so fast AND THE WORST PART IS, they dont fucking understand. 

its like my future is on hold because everytime i have anything important going on, they come in with their bs.
im so tired bro, i just want out.

no words can describe how broken im feeling right now. i just want to be okay.
im not here for advice, ive tried everything to make it better (i think).

489,"I am unable to have conversations with Muslim brothers or sisters.

I grew up in non-practicing Shia family from Iran and we never really used the words “assalamualaikum” and “walaikumSalam.” They were seen as too formal and you’d get mocked for being a ‘sheikh’ or if your are woman; ‘mary, the virgin.’ 

So it’s really unnatural for me to use those Arabic terms (e.g jazakallah khair, allahummabarik, mashallah, inshallah) among other people, especially family members!

When talking to another Muslim brother or sister and they use these Arabic terms; I can see that they’re waiting to hear the response, but I instantly freeze. I blank out and proceed to respond with “thanks!” in an obnoxiously white-washed tone.

Afterwards, I feel embarrassed and frustrated at myself. How do I combat this?

Im making this post because i am a little bit confused on how to make Tawbah. I understand that someone can make Salatul Tawbah but someone doesnt generally have to pray Salatul Tawbah so my question is, how to make Tawbah? I know that there are conditions for Tawbah but i my question is more like do i have to verbally say something or do something? Are there certain phrases to say when doing Tawbah? What i usually do is i make Tawbah after the Fard prayers by cupping my hands and making like a Dua‘a and kinda like counting many sins that i have made during that period, but then i kinda make like an very long Dua‘a sometimes almost longer than the Fard prayer and i dont know if i might be exaggerating. But i also dont know if saying Astaghfirullah after a sin is considered Tawbah. Can someone help me?

He pays the rent and electricity bill,my mom takes care of all the rest of expenses
He cut off my brother since he was 18(now 24) because he was 'difficult' he was incredibly mean to him, physically verbally and emotionaly abusivs and didn't talk a word to him for years even tho we all live together

Since turning 20 my brother figured his life out,got a diploma got a job a car and saved a lot of money, now dad mellowed down he still doesn't talk to him but he talks well behind his back now, now he admits he's his son

Now I'm a 21F, he liked me very much until I turned 19,then I failed my last year in school and he cut me off for three months and then talked to me again but seemed very disappointed, I was weirded out because he never cared or contributed to my education
I failed the second time too and he cut me off for much longer,I took it a final Time but mid third year he one day cussed me out because I was still up studying with the light on at 10 pm,he spit on me and called me the worst things and since then he didn't talk to me even tho I finally graduated and now I'm in college
He's been throwing mean words and extremely hateful stares at me for no reason,my mom had asked him multiple times why he's acting like this,each time it was something different 'she never picks up the phone' or 'she doesn't wash my clothes' or whatever,none of these excuses are true and even if they were they really aren't enough to drop your child

About 30 minutes ago he walked in,seemed drunk, and started screaming at me for taking his charger and ruining all his things(which I didn't wth ) he said he'll slaughter me, he'll kill me,I made him suffer for two years,he prays I'll fail in everything in my life that he hates me so much,that all I do is show my breast and arms(because I was wearing a tank top and wide pants as pjs in my room) and he hit me with the cable twice

I've been sitting here for the last 30 minutes crying my eyes out,I don't deserve this and I don't know what to do
I don't know why he hates me and I don't wanna be abused anymore, I'm actually scared he might seriously hurt me severely at one point I really don't wanna keep living like this in a home like this
What do I do I'm so heartbroken right now and I don't know what to do"

And I dont want such a temptation to take me away from Allah, with Whom I'm trying to be a better Muslim for. 

Please guide me. What should I do? I dont want to abandon these friends as my first solution, because they're not bad people, but their lives go against what Muslims should do. Should I stay their friend but let them be while living my life as I choose? But wont that inevitably lead to a clash between us?

497,"Hi. I’m (15f).
My family has a confusing history but to simplify things.
My mom’s side is Hindu, my dad’s side is Muslim
But both my parents are atheists and pretty much against me following Islam.

when I was around 11-12 ish years old..I started getting closer to Islam. And I felt that connection with Allah (swt).
I was born as a Muslim by birth as formally it’s in my passport as Muslim because we tend to follow the father’s way of things n all in india.

Anyway..since then I’ve been Muslim by choice..at least I’ve tried to. But for the past year or more even, my faith level has fallen down immensely.

yes I’ve fasted in Ramadan and prayed…after a LOT of fights with my parents that is.

And after that I sort of gave up..I just haven’t prayed. I say I want to, but I just don’t feel like doing it..

I can see myself getting consumed into the problems of this dunya.
But honestly it’s much easier like this than constantly hiding every prayer. and at this moment I don’t know how to start again, where will I pray? How will I dress (most of my clothes are short sleeved..though I  do always cover till ankles and lower)..and what wil I pray on? I don’t have a prayer mat, and we just shifted our house and it’s really dirty, so we are wearing shoes inside for the time being.

How would I be completely secretive about this? And I’m afraid I don’t know the correct way exactly how to pray as welll. I get embarrassed in school seeing my friends all going for salah without me.

I don’t know what to do. Please advice.
JazakAllah"

I’m always stuck at home and people don’t appreciate what I say. I am always so depressed and I have so many urges to just cut myself. I am the exact opposite of who I was last year, when I hated religion I was also much more popular and approachable. Idk I’m just so  discouraged and I feel so so so alone. I cry to god all the time but I feel like he’s not listening to me because of the things I’ve done before or that maybe I have in my heart some wrong intention and that’s why he’s not listening to me.

Now i will be 18 next months and they are going to fire me from their home and i will be homeless… all this wouldn't have happened if I had told the judge the truth. I seriously hate them, by all my heart, i’m living hell everyday, i spent 2 months in psych ward after failed suicide attempts and they are the main reason that i did that and they told me that i’m faking depression.

Whenever, I go to the public spots in our university, I see girls and boys in relationship which makes me kind of jealous. My roommate always tells me this is wrong and I know it is. But when I stay from such things, I feel very lonely. I have thought about Nikah but there are two things that bother me.   


First, I think about how I am going to carry the burden of another person, while I am not capable of even supporting myself.   


Second, I think that in these times no women would ever just say yes to my Nikah proposal, they will want to come in a relationship first to get to know each other.

I think a college classmate (Non-musium) of mine might have taken a false promise of mine. He said in a text ""Bro i swear on you i literally remembered you today."" Which i think is a casual way of showing closeness to a friend where i am from.
My question is, are swears and promises real according to islam? And what happens if someone takes false promise/swear of mine.

PS. Where i live (India) it is said you shouldn't take a false promise of anyone, if you do that person (The one whose promise is taken) D!3S.
Please forgive if this sounds pretty silly. Thank you."

&#x200B;

I am a Muslim who observes all the fard and engages in some sunnah practices as well. For 11 years, I have been committing a particular sin weekly, which has led me to constantly feel like a hypocrite and a bad Muslim. I came across a video on YouTube where an Imam mentioned that Allah would replace every sin abandoned with something good. A year ago, I started reciting a specific dua. I have been persistent in repeating the dua, and have done and said everything possible to seek its acceptance - shedding tears during my dua, performing tahajjud, observing Lailatul Qadr, making dua during rainfall, and so on. However, the thought that I need to forsake this sin for Allah to accept my dua continues to trouble me. Has anyone experienced a similar situation or is familiar with a hadith that addresses this?"

This post is a reminder for everyone brothers and sisters:

 Please take care of yourself and do not let empathy make you forget your boundaries; healthy boundaries are good for everyone as in Islam we should not hurt ourself nor hurt others

 in Arabic it is said this way "" لا ضر ولا ضرار""

Do not forget our moral compass is made by God , and he called us  the middle nation 
""الامة الوسطى""!

Abuse self abuse, abuse by parents, by walis or by anyone to anyone, in anyways is forbidden , we are AMANA to ourselves , and we are the AMANA of our parents etc etc

So have faith in Allah subhanaho wa taala but be smart about what you learn in our beautiful deen,  don't take teachings of Islam in extreme manners, your safety comes first ! 

بأمان الله with god's protection, i hope this helps someone

PS : Amana is something given to you but not yours that you ought to care of before giving back intact or in better shape to it s owner : here our owner is God 😍"

Its even wrong to judge someone like that islamically but I understand if I was going to a job interview or working at a specific place then yes there are certain things and norms which you have to follow but in my everyday life where I am not bound by those contextual norms how is it fair to judge me and furthermore someone's definition of what is presentable and what is not is so dependent on where they come from

I pray my 5 prayers every single day and usually prioritize my day around it, so why is it I still don’t feel a connection to prayer?

I am a revert (western upbringing, raised without religion, found Islam via my soon to be husband). 
I have an issue to which I seek your guidance. 

My family does not know that I am Muslim. They have always been against Islam (misinformed by mainstream media), and their biggest fear is me becoming Muslim. They are not religious in any way. My father has expressed great concern in this area, and has flat out side, that it would be difficult to maintain a relationship with me, if I became Muslim or tried to force my spouse’S “Muslim lifestyle” on him or the rest of the family. 

My spouse and I were talking about different scenarios, one of them being family events where alcohol is being consumed. My partner does not wish to partake in these, and does not want me there either. The problem is, that I can’t ask my father not to serve alcohol. My family does not get drunk, but they enjoy a beer or a glass of wine. 
How do I navigate this situation? If i have to exclude myself, my spouse and our future kids from family events where alcohol is involved, we would not be able to partake in birthdays, family dinners etc. 

How do I navigate this? I don’t want to disappoint my spouse, I want to do right by my religion, but I don’t want to lose my family.

also, i have been having on and off troubles with this friends for a while, i wonder is this a sign from Allah that we are just not meant for friendship? or, is it Allah trying to distance me from her to protect her because i am possibly not a good influence? (due to my sins)"
529,"Hello all, I’m in my 30s and I’ve recently (past year) become incredibly depressed. I work all day every day and don’t get to see my family other than weekends but you know, that’s life so I do it. Over the span of the past 4-5 months though with my emptiness I’ve decided to give religion another go seeing as I find myself praying more and more. Growing up we were raised primarily southern baptist but I tried catholic services as well but both felt unfulfilling and I never felt closer to god. I work with a Muslim guy and I’ve been reading about Islam and I think where I’m at in life I could actually make a connection. I have so many questions though and I don’t mean to be offensive so please forgive me, but if I don’t fully engulf myself in the faith is it worth it? I know y’all give yourself 100% to your faith but certain things I couldn’t do. I can’t convert my wife, I try to refrain from the food y’all consider haram already but I have been known to eat pork at times (where I live pig is the bigger export. I just know I want to learn more, get closer to god, and I absolutely love the message that Islam spreads. “Just be a good person” was the best way my coworker explained it, he shows me nothing but love and is the most positive person in the building so I really believe I can gain a lot. 

Sorry if my post is sporadic I have ADD and I’m on the spectrum. If y’all have recommendations at on books to read besides the Quran (biographies and the such)"
530,"I dont know why im writing this, is it because I’ve not vented out in a very long time? Is it because i cant put what im going through into words? I’ve been in constant thinking to the point where its harming me physically, i cant let out the words to explain my situation but its really hard. Its been 2 months now, I haven’t had fun, I haven’t stopped thinking, i haven’t been focusing, I’ve not been alive. Its like im here but no here, im everywhere but in one place, im in my room, on my bed, there but no there, existing but not alive. I miss how happy i was, how free i felt, how peaceful i felt. The only thing giving me patience is that i know Allah will figure everything out for me, i have this last bit of hope that everything will be solved. If my family was in the same country im in, I would’ve not worried anymore, its the decisions that i took these past months got me to the situation im at today, but i ask god forgiveness, i ask him that he takes away what im going through, i ask him to grant me health, i ask him to grant me ease, i ask him to give me another chance, i ask him to give me the patience i need and the peace i need. Ya Allah, i know I’ve sinned, but please ya rab, don’t punish me, i repent ya Allah and I’ll never be back to the past life. Ya Allah grant me the opportunity to meet to family whenever i need, ya Allah grant me the opportunity to be successful, ya Allah grant me the opportunity to be healthy, ya Allah grant me the opportunity to visit Makkah and ask you for your forgiveness, mercy, success, peace, happiness. Ya Allah allow me to be whom i was but in a better way, ya Allah dont punish me ya Allah. Alhamdulilah for everything ya Allah. Thank you ya Allah

533,"Assalamualaikum everyone! I was just sitting yesterday contemplating my life and how i came back to Islam then this thought crossed my mind ! And ik maybe I'm not the only one who has gone through this but I don't think we ever realised how much depth is in our Shahada like they are steps in life for becoming a Momin . I will clear what I mean and how much we all will relate to this 

1- La ilaha  ' There is no god' we all have gone through this phase once in our life when we turned our back to our faith ! I myself became an atheist because of my inferiority complex of being a Muslim . This is the step where we are at the peak of our arrogance and desires

2 -Illallah  ' Except Allah' .This steps comes in our lives when we are lost and broken and realise that we need someone and something to beleive in we learn and realise our lord exists and we go against our first statement that there is no god

3- muḥammadun rasūlu llāh'  '(""Muhammad is the Messenger of God"").
This is the last and final step of our acceptance and this happens when we realise who our  Prophet ﷺ was and how much he sacrificed for us, we accept him and his love for us ! We love him back more than anything on this planet and long to meet him in the hearafter

534,"For me, it was being bothered by a jinn that caused me dizziness, heart beating fast and feeling fainting when entering a mosque for Friday prayers and the symptoms immediately subsided when I left the mosque. Symptoms also shows up when I'm looking and reciting the Quran. Science can't explain anything on that trust me, the doctors said I was fine and I'm just ""imagining it"", as if those symptoms were controlled by me for an entire year. Then my dad asked for a scholar to perform a ruqyah and the jinn got out of me(felt something came out). After that, I can go to the mosque and look/recite Quran as normal, no symptoms whatsoever, that's where I know Islam is the truth and nobody can convince that it's not, unless they felt what I felt.

This is not about me specifically. But even if we use the scenario that this is a more religious Muslim. I don’t want to answer these questions and get into a debate. I am not going to lie about Islam (that might be kufr?) so what do I do? If I wanted to stay being treated like a normal person, what do I do when they find out certain things about Islam?

I believe in Islam 100% regardless of how much I sin and even about things that are controversial to kaffirs. I need to mention my religion sometimes due to me having to practice it. But I do not know how to properly defend Islam. In fact, I prefer to not debate or argue at all especially because I don’t have enough knowledge.

34m russian US citizen living in Ukraine

curious if it's possible to islamically marry someone who shared your ideals (to love each other for sake of Allah and love people in need for sake of Allah, and hate together evil doers for sake of Allah) - or it's just gotta be impersonal business transaction ""money for sex, children""? 

i've been seeking for nikkah for a while, and i'm convert - so i spent doing zina majority of my life, previously married for 7 years. somehow i found that kaffir approach for dating is just way more personal, islamic way - i feel myself as a wallet, nothing more at all in the context.

strikingly, i'm member of few purely professional russian muslim software engineering communities. there, amongst brothers-professionals, talking mostly about profession - it feels right home and they - brothers who don't intend to marry each other - me and other tend to communicate more of the personal goals, beliefs, deen etc than in conversations i had related to nikkah with muslimas and their walis - in nikkah conversations it literally was just that - money/lifestyle evaluation. like it's long term brothel deal

549,"Selam,

I came across this Hadith:

It was narrated from Aishah that:
the Messenger of Allah said: “Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me. Get married, for I will boast of your great numbers before the nations. Whoever has the means, let him get married, and whoever does not, then he should fast for it will diminish his desire.” (Sunan Ibn Majah 1846)

Now look at this Hadith:

Narrated Abu Huraira:

A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, ""Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it."" The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, ""Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan."" The Bedouin said, ""By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this."" When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, ""Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man."" (Volume 2, Book 23, Number 480:)

1. This man in the second Hadith clearly will only do fard prayer, that means he will leave out the prophets sunnah.
However, in the first Hadith we learn that when we leave out the sunnah of the prophet, we ""have nothing to do with him"".

2. The prophet boasting, although boasting is seen as arrogant behavior in Islam. The only way I can think of is that it is meant as a "" See, that is my nation that follwed me"" (towards the kaffirs who slandered him)... a revenge type of boasting which we often fund in apologetics also.

3. How long should a Muslim fast if he doesn't intend to marry?

Clarification: Maybe the arabic versions have more to say about this (I'm not an arab) + I'm a Hadith follower, that means if you are a hardcore Qur'anist, don't waste your time.

Assalamun-Aleykum"

 In the world of sacred texts, the Quran stands as a profound source of divine wisdom. As the holy book of Islam, it serves as a spiritual compass, guiding over a billion Muslims around the globe in matters of faith, morality, and conduct. Yet, beyond its religious significance, the Quran holds within its verses a timeless message, resonating with profound insights that transcend borders and beliefs.

The Quran is more than a book; it is a revelation—a direct conversation between God (Allah) and humanity. Its verses, known as Ayahs, span topics as diverse as monotheism (Tawhid), compassion (Rahma), justice (Adl), and gratitude (Shukr). Its teachings touch upon the fundamental aspects of human existence and the eternal quest for purpose and meaning.

In this exploration, we embark on a journey through the Quran’s sacred verses to uncover its key lessons. These lessons are not confined to the realm of religious doctrine; rather, they offer universal principles for ethical living, fostering compassion, justice, and a deeper connection with the Divine. As we delve into the Quran’s wisdom, let us cast aside preconceptions and embrace the opportunity to learn, reflect, and be inspired by the profound teachings that continue to guide and transform lives worldwide.

### Understanding the Quran

In the heart of Islamic faith, the Quran holds a unique and revered place. To truly appreciate its teachings, we must first grasp its nature, structure, and the profound role it plays in the lives of Muslims.

**The Quran: A Divine Revelation:** The Quran is not an ordinary book; it is the embodiment of divine revelation. Muslims believe it to be the literal word of God (Allah) as conveyed to the Prophet Muhammad over a span of approximately 23 years. The Quran was revealed in Arabic and is revered not only for its spiritual guidance but also for its linguistic beauty and poetic depth.

**Structural Framework: Surahs and Ayahs:** The Quran is organized into chapters called Surahs, each of varying lengths. These Surahs are then divided into verses, known as Ayahs. In total, there are 114 Surahs and nearly 6,000 Ayahs in the Quran. This structured framework helps convey its messages with clarity and depth.

**Guidance for All Aspects of Life:** The Quran serves as the primary source of Islamic law (Sharia), offering guidance on every facet of life. It addresses theological beliefs, rituals, ethics, morality, and social justice. As such, it plays a pivotal role in the daily lives of Muslims, influencing their decisions, actions, and values.

### The Quranic Message

To understand the Quran’s key lessons, it’s essential to grasp the central message that reverberates through its verses—a message that encapsulates the essence of the Islamic faith and offers insights into broader human themes.

**The Oneness of God (Tawhid):** At the core of the Quranic message lies the belief in the oneness of God, known as Tawhid in Arabic. The Quran emphatically asserts that there is no deity but God (Allah), and that He is the sole Creator, Sustainer, and Sovereign of the universe. This central tenet is reiterated throughout the Quran, emphasizing monotheism as the foundation of the Islamic faith. It invites reflection on the nature of divinity, the relationship between humanity and the Creator, and the ultimate purpose of life.

**A Continuation of Divine Revelation:** The Quran acknowledges the continuity of divine guidance through earlier prophets and scriptures. It honors figures like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus as bearers of God’s message. Muslims believe that the Quran completes this line of prophetic guidance, serving as the final revelation to humanity. This recognition of previous revelations reinforces the idea of a shared spiritual heritage and underlines the interconnectedness of faiths.

**Submission and Surrender (Islam):** The term “Islam” itself derives from the Arabic word meaning “submission” or “surrender to God’s will.” The Quran calls upon individuals to embrace this concept fully—to submit themselves willingly to the divine decree. It teaches that true peace and contentment are found in submitting to God’s guidance, trusting in His wisdom, and aligning one’s life with His commandments. This submission extends to all aspects of life, from personal conduct to social justice.

**Universal Values and Ethics:** While the Quran provides guidance specific to the Islamic faith, it also presents universal values and ethics that are relevant to all of humanity. It emphasizes the importance of compassion, justice, honesty, and integrity in one’s actions and relationships. These values serve as a moral compass, guiding individuals toward virtuous conduct and harmonious coexistence with others.

**Our Shared Humanity:** The Quran’s message transcends the boundaries of any single faith, inviting individuals from all walks of life to contemplate their existence, their relationship with the divine, and their responsibilities toward themselves and others. Its teachings encourage reflection, self-improvement, and a deeper connection with the Creator.

### Key Quranic Values and Teachings

Within the Quran’s verses, we discover a tapestry of values and teachings that illuminate the path of righteousness, compassion, and ethical conduct. These values form the bedrock of the Quranic message, guiding individuals in their quest for moral and spiritual growth. Let’s look at some of them in detail:

#### Lesson 1: Tawhid (Monotheism)

Tawhid is the cornerstone of Islamic belief, representing the profound concept of the oneness of God. The Quran teaches unequivocally that there is only one God (Allah), the Creator of the universe and the Sustainer of all life. This belief, encapsulated in the Islamic declaration, “La ilaha illallah” (There is no god but God), emphasizes the absolute and undivided nature of God’s essence, power, and authority.

Tawhid holds immense theological significance in Islam. It affirms the uniqueness and sovereignty of God, rejecting any form of polytheism or the association of partners with God. The Quran categorically opposes idol worship and the attribution of divine qualities to created beings. This fundamental doctrine distinguishes Islam as a monotheistic faith, reinforcing the concept that God alone is the ultimate source of guidance, support, and purpose.

Beyond theology, Tawhid has practical implications that extend into every facet of a Muslim’s life. It instills a profound sense of monotheism, serving as a constant reminder that all aspects of life should be directed towards God. This belief encourages unwavering devotion and trust in God’s plan, fostering a deep and meaningful relationship with the Divine.

In the realm of spirituality, Tawhid is transformative. It calls individuals not only to acknowledge God’s oneness intellectually but to experience it spiritually. The Quran frequently describes God as “The Most Merciful” and “The Most Compassionate,” inviting believers to turn to Him in prayer, seeking His guidance, forgiveness, and mercy. Tawhid brings believers closer to God, fostering a sense of humility, gratitude, and awe in the presence of the Divine.

Tawhid also underscores the unity found in diversity. While it emphasizes the oneness of God, it acknowledges the diversity of creation. The Quran recognizes the multiplicity of cultures, languages, and nations as signs of God’s creative power. It encourages mutual respect and cooperation among people of different backgrounds, emphasizing that all are ultimately accountable to the One God.

The concept of Tawhid isn’t confined to the Islamic faith alone. It carries universal relevance, inviting individuals, regardless of their religious affiliation, to contemplate the nature of divinity, the interconnectedness of all life, and the pursuit of a meaningful and purposeful existence. Tawhid challenges individuals to reflect on fundamental questions of existence and the role of the divine in their lives, making it a concept that transcends religious boundaries and resonates with those seeking a deeper understanding of the divine and their place in the world.

#### Lesson 2: Compassion and Mercy (Rahma)

Compassion and mercy are recurring themes in the Quran, representing fundamental attributes of God. These qualities are beautifully encapsulated in the names of God: “The Most Merciful” (Ar-Rahman) and “The Most Compassionate” (Ar-Rahim). Throughout the Quranic text, believers are urged to emulate these divine attributes in their lives.

Compassion (Rahma) encompasses a profound empathy and concern for the well-being of all living beings. It calls for individuals to extend kindness, help, and support to others, recognizing the shared humanity that unites us. The Quran encourages acts of generosity, forgiveness, and understanding as expressions of compassion.

Mercy (Rahmah) goes hand in hand with compassion, signifying a deep and abiding care for the welfare of others. It prompts believers to show leniency and forgiveness, even in the face of wrongdoing. The Quranic teachings on mercy underline the importance of reconciliation and peace, advocating for the resolution of conflicts through dialogue and understanding.

In essence, the lesson of compassion and mercy from the Quran invites individuals to nurture a heart of kindness and benevolence. It encourages not only empathy for those in need but also forgiveness for those who may have wronged us. This lesson promotes the building of harmonious relationships and a sense of shared humanity that transcends cultural, religious, and social boundaries.

Compassion and mercy are universal values that resonate with people from diverse backgrounds and belief systems. They serve as a moral compass, guiding individuals toward virtuous conduct and fostering a more compassionate and just society. The Quran’s emphasis on these qualities reminds us of the profound impact that acts of kindness, forgiveness, and understanding can have on our lives and the lives of those around us.

#### Lesson 3: Justice and Equity (Adl)

Justice and equity are integral themes in the Quran, embodying fundamental principles that guide both personal conduct and societal governance. The Quran advocates for the fair and equitable treatment of all individuals, regardless of their background, beliefs, or social status.

This emphasis on justice and equity reflects a moral imperative. The Quranic vision of justice extends to the establishment of equitable systems, where the rule of law ensures that rights and responsibilities are upheld for all members of society. It calls for the eradication of oppression and discrimination in all forms and underlines the ethical duty to ensure that the vulnerable and marginalized are protected.

The Quran’s teachings on justice and equity resonate with universal values. They encourage individuals to act with fairness, empathy, and compassion in their interactions with others, fostering harmonious relationships and a just society. This lesson reminds us that justice is not a mere legal concept but a profound ethical principle that forms the foundation of a society built on equality, dignity, and human rights.

#### Lesson 4: Patience and Gratitude (Sabr and Shukr)

In the Quran, patience (Sabr) and gratitude (Shukr) are profound virtues that shape the moral and spiritual landscape of a believer’s life. These two concepts, while seemingly contrasting, are intricately woven together, providing guidance on how to navigate the ebb and flow of life.

**Patience (Sabr):** Patience, in the Quranic context, is not passive endurance but an active, steadfast perseverance in the face of adversity, trials, and challenges. It’s about maintaining one’s faith and trust in God’s wisdom during difficult times. The Quran extols the virtues of patience, reminding believers that hardships are a part of life’s journey. Patience allows individuals to endure difficulties with resilience, without losing hope, and to rely on God’s support.

**Gratitude (Shukr):** Gratitude, on the other hand, is the act of acknowledging and appreciating God’s blessings, both large and small. It’s a reminder that everything, from the air we breathe to the sustenance we enjoy, is a gift from the Divine. The Quran emphasizes the importance of gratitude as a means to increase blessings and invites believers to be thankful for the abundance in their lives.

Together, Sabr and Shukr form a harmonious balance. Patience helps individuals navigate life’s trials with strength and resilience, while gratitude encourages them to recognize and appreciate the blessings bestowed upon them, even in challenging times. This duality of virtues teaches believers not to despair during adversity and not to take their blessings for granted during times of ease.

Furthermore, these virtues extend beyond individual well-being. They foster compassion, empathy, and a sense of community. Through patience, individuals can support and uplift one another in times of need, and through gratitude, they can share their blessings with those less fortunate.

The Quran’s teachings on Sabr and Shukr encourage believers to develop emotional resilience and a positive outlook on life. They remind individuals to remain steadfast in their faith and to appreciate the abundance of God’s blessings, creating a sense of contentment and inner peace. In essence, these lessons serve as a blueprint for navigating life’s challenges and joys with grace and gratitude, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and spiritually enriched existence.

#### Lesson 5: Humility and Stewardship

The Quran teaches the profound lessons of humility and stewardship, reminding individuals of their place in the grand tapestry of creation. It encourages an attitude of humility before the Creator, recognizing God’s ultimate sovereignty over all aspects of existence. This humility fosters a sense of awe and reverence, encouraging individuals to approach life with a profound awareness of the divine presence.

Simultaneously, the Quran calls upon humanity to recognize their role as stewards (Amanah) of the Earth. This stewardship extends to the environment, natural resources, and all living beings. It emphasizes the ethical responsibility to protect and preserve the Earth for future generations, promoting sustainable and responsible practices.

In essence, the lesson of humility and stewardship from the Quran reminds us that, while we are part of the intricate web of creation, we are not its masters. We are entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the Earth and all that resides upon it. This recognition of our place as humble stewards calls for a harmonious and sustainable coexistence with the natural world, fostering respect for the environment and all living creatures.

This Quranic lesson serves as a timeless reminder of the interconnectedness of all life and our duty to safeguard the planet for current and future generations. It transcends religious boundaries, inspiring individuals of diverse backgrounds to embrace a sense of humility, responsibility, and environmental stewardship in their daily lives.

#### Lesson 6: Trust in God (Tawakkul)

Trust in God, known as Tawakkul, is a profound lesson from the Quran that encourages individuals to rely on God’s guidance and providence while taking responsible actions in their lives. This concept is central to the Islamic faith and has universal significance.

Tawakkul teaches that while humans should strive, plan, and work diligently to achieve their goals, the ultimate outcome lies in God’s hands. It emphasizes the importance of surrendering to God’s divine will and accepting that, ultimately, He is the One who controls the results of our efforts.

This lesson promotes inner peace and resilience, as individuals learn to trust that God’s plan is always just and merciful, even in the face of adversity or challenges. Tawakkul encourages believers to avoid excessive worry, anxiety, or despair and instead place their trust in God’s wisdom and goodness.

In practical terms, Tawakkul doesn’t mean passivity or inaction. It means that while we strive and work hard, we do so with the awareness that success or failure ultimately depends on God’s decree. This balance between effort and trust in God’s plan brings a sense of tranquility, as individuals are freed from the burdens of excessive stress and attachment to outcomes.

Tawakkul also teaches humility, as it acknowledges that humans are limited in their understanding and control over the complexities of life. Trusting in God requires acknowledging our dependence on Him and recognizing that He knows what is best for us, even when we may not understand His plan.

This lesson extends beyond religious boundaries, resonating with individuals of various beliefs who seek a sense of peace and trust in the face of life’s uncertainties. It encourages us to approach our goals and challenges with a sense of purpose and confidence, knowing that we can do our best while also trusting in the greater wisdom and plan of the divine.

#### Lesson 7: Forgiveness and Reconciliation

The Quran’s teachings on forgiveness and reconciliation hold profound significance for both Muslims and humanity at large. While forgiveness and reconciliation encompass various aspects of life and relationships, the Quran’s guidance on these principles is both comprehensive and profound.

Forgiveness, as highlighted in the Quran, is a virtue of the highest order. It involves letting go of anger, resentment, and the desire for revenge when wronged by others. The Quran acknowledges that humans are fallible and may commit errors or wrongdoings. Therefore, it encourages individuals to show clemency and forgiveness when faced with transgressions.

Moreover, the Quran’s message extends beyond individual forgiveness to forgiveness at a societal and community level. It emphasizes the importance of reconciliation and conflict resolution within communities and among nations. The Quran advocates peaceful dialogue and negotiation, urging parties in conflict to seek common ground and resolution through peaceful means.

Forgiveness and reconciliation are not merely acts of kindness but profound moral imperatives in the Quran. They align with the divine attributes of mercy and compassion, traits that believers are encouraged to embody in their interactions with others. The Quran describes God as “The Most Forgiving” and “The Most Merciful,” inviting believers to emulate these attributes in their relationships.

Forgiveness and reconciliation also have a transformative effect on individuals and communities. They break the cycle of resentment and revenge, replacing it with healing and harmony. They promote a sense of empathy and understanding, fostering a climate of cooperation and goodwill.

In the broader context of humanity, the Quran’s teachings on forgiveness and reconciliation are a beacon of hope. They emphasize that reconciliation is always possible, no matter how deep the divisions or conflicts. By adhering to the principles of forgiveness and reconciliation, individuals and communities can work towards a more just, peaceful, and harmonious world.

In summary, the Quran’s lesson on forgiveness and reconciliation underscores the transformative power of forgiveness, not only in individual lives but also in communities and societies. It promotes the values of mercy, compassion, and peaceful coexistence, offering a path to healing and harmony in a world often marred by conflicts and divisions.

#### Lesson 8: Honesty and Integrity (Sidq)

Honesty and integrity, encapsulated in the Arabic term “Sidq,” are revered virtues in Islam. The Quran places great emphasis on truthfulness and ethical conduct in personal and business dealings.

Honesty is not merely a superficial quality but a profound commitment to truth in thought, word, and action. It involves being truthful even when it’s challenging, avoiding deception, and upholding one’s promises and commitments. Integrity, closely linked to honesty, entails consistency in one’s principles and values, regardless of external pressures.

The Quran extols the virtues of honesty, reminding believers that truthful words and upright actions reflect moral character. Deceit and dishonesty, on the other hand, lead to distrust and moral decay in society.

The importance of honesty and integrity is not limited to personal interactions but extends to business and financial transactions. The Quran advises fair and transparent dealings, free from fraud, exploitation, and unjust gain. Such ethical conduct promotes trust, cooperation, and economic stability within society.

In essence, the lesson of honesty and integrity found in the Quran serves as a guiding principle for ethical behavior. It encourages individuals to uphold truth and moral values in all aspects of life, fostering trustworthiness and promoting harmonious relationships within society.

#### Lesson 9: Humility and Graciousness

Humility and graciousness are virtues highly esteemed in the Quran’s teachings. The Quran encourages individuals to embody these qualities in their character and interactions with others.

**Humility**: The Quran advises believers to avoid arrogance and pride. Instead, it promotes an attitude of humility and modesty. This humility is not self-deprecation but rather a recognition of one’s limitations and an acknowledgment of the vastness of divine wisdom and knowledge. By cultivating humility, individuals can approach life with a sense of openness and receptivity, willing to learn from others and grow spiritually.

**Graciousness**: Graciousness, often referred to as “Karam” in Islamic tradition, encompasses being kind, generous, and magnanimous towards others. The Quran encourages believers to extend their kindness and generosity to those in need, emphasizing the importance of charity (Sadaqah) and acts of goodwill. Graciousness fosters harmonious relationships, strengthens communities, and reflects the principles of compassion and empathy.

Humility and graciousness, as emphasized in the Quran, extend beyond religious boundaries. They are universal values that resonate with individuals from diverse backgrounds and beliefs. These virtues promote a spirit of mutual respect, cooperation, and understanding among people, fostering a sense of shared humanity and contributing to a more compassionate and inclusive world.

#### Lesson 10: Reflection on the Signs of God

The final lesson that the Quran teaches us is that it tells us to reflect upon the signs of God present in the universe and within ourselves. This lesson encourages a profound sense of contemplation, urging believers to observe and ponder the wonders of creation, the intricacies of the natural world, and the complexities of human existence.

In the Quran, nature and the universe are often referred to as “Ayat” (signs) of God’s existence and power. Believers are called to look at the heavens, the earth, the mountains, the animals, and the changing seasons as manifestations of God’s creative brilliance. This reflection serves as a reminder of the Creator’s majesty and wisdom.

Additionally, the Quran directs individuals to reflect on their own existence. It encourages introspection into the human self, consciousness, and the purpose of life. This self-reflection leads to a deeper understanding of one’s own nature, the distinction between the physical body and the soul, and the eternal dimension of the human spirit.

By contemplating the signs of God, individuals can gain insights into the divine purpose behind the universe and their place within it. This practice fosters a sense of humility, gratitude, and awe in the face of the profound mysteries of existence.

This lesson extends beyond religious boundaries and is accessible to individuals of all faiths and beliefs. It invites humanity to explore the profound questions of life, the mysteries of the universe, and the quest for spiritual growth and understanding. Ultimately, the Quranic message encourages individuals to engage in continuous reflection, nurturing a deep connection with the divine and a greater awareness of the world around them.

### Conclusion

Each of these lessons we discussed carries profound significance, transcending religious boundaries and inviting individuals from all backgrounds to contemplate the human experience, the divine presence, and the universal values that unite us.

As we conclude this Quranic journey of ours, it’s important to recognize that the Quran’s teachings are not meant to be confined to intellectual exploration alone. The next step is to embody these lessons in our daily lives, to let them guide our actions and decisions, and to share their universal wisdom with others.

Let us carry forward the spirit of compassion, justice, humility, and gratitude as we navigate the complexities of our world. May the lessons of the Quran serve as a beacon of guidance, fostering unity and understanding among all people, and ultimately leading us to lives of purpose, integrity, and devotion.

567,"I noticed that there's been weird questions lately in this sub. 

1. Why Allah created us? Does he need us?
2. Why did Allah made humans have s""x and not lay eggs like fish
3. Girlfriend is Muslim but she wanna marry non Muslim and nothing can stop us. Also how do I approach her religious dad?
4. Why pray if everything is decided by Allah


It's like during certain times, these kinds of questions and statements showed up at once and then all of a sudden, it disappears after a few weeks. And I noticed that most of these questions are from non Muslims, especially the atheist. They want an answer but when they got the answer, they can't accept it. Then why ask lol.

Edit : Next time someone asks a weird question, just leave it be and let them find that answer on their own.  They know to that answer, , but due to ego and other reasons I'm not gonna say, they chose to ask those weird questions here. Trust me, if they're intelligent people, they wouldn't go to reddit and ask here. They look for the main valid sources, not on reddit. That's the funny part about us humans. We seek validation, approval, attention but in the wrong way"
568,"I know that there’s benefits in islam if you pray with other muslims in a mosque and greater hasanat in unity…but where does it say in the quran/hadith that islam is a PERSONAL one on one relationship with god? Does it ever say that there’s benefit in a personal relationship with Allah without it being a group thing? 

I have a personal issue where seeing other people with the same religion as me be hateful and ignorant, and me then thinking “do i really want to have a connection with THEIR point of view” but then islam is about you and god and at the end of the day you are judged on your actions. 

***i have no interest in going around praying with people or talking about Allah or islam with other people…is this a bad thing and is it okay if i make islam this…..personal***"

580,"I'm 16 years old, and I've just started praying. I know. I'm very late. I'll admit I wasn't a staunch believer, but I've had a long streak of bad luck that I now believe is the result of me not being close to my Deen. I started praying maybe a week ago, with one a day just so I could build the habit first. I've never been someone with a lot of dedication or willpower and that has led me to miss today's prayer. I feel very guilty, and I'm scared that bad things will start happening again as punishment.

Any time I try to follow more of my religion, I fail tremendously. I seriously lack guidance and motivation. Does anyone have some words of wisdom they could offer?"

I’ve read the Quran in Arabic all my life until a couple years ago i started to read pretty much just the translation mostly bc i thoroughly wanted to understand what i’m reading since i speak urdu not arabic. I recently was told that it’s better to read in Arabic , but doesn’t it make sense to read it and understand it rather than just reading it to read it? I get its better to read in the language it was written in but is it a bad thing to just read it in English or just not the best way?"
585,So let’s say someone does something that makes him a kafir but we as muslims say the shahada multiple times a day so if we go out of the fold of islam we’ll become muslim again by saying the shahada (even if we don’t know we have committed shirk?)

590,"I wasn’t raised very religious or taught how to properly pray, I would fast and recite prayer before sleep and that was it. I started exploring and getting closer to Islam on my own after moving out for university. I then moved cities again to do a PhD, here the drinking culture is extremely strong. Every Friday, whenever it’s sunny, all my colleagues/work friends are always drinking. I don’t know any other people here and it’s hard to make friends after a certain age, if we are sitting on the field on campus I try to join as I really like the people I work with and we get on really well, since getting closer to Islam I’ve gotten further away from my friends from home and from my undergrad (as I only visit home for birthdays and they always want to go out clubbing/to bars) and I can’t get much closer to my work friends here. I feel incredibly lonely and I hate to say it but I really do want to join them at the pub to join in on the discussion, when people leave campus to go to an actual bar I head home but I feel really left out and lonely… I need encouragement and strength, I feel so isolated because I try not to participate in the drinking culture but I don’t know anyone around me (as I’m new to the city) who doesn’t either.

I feel so lonely, I don’t have family here, and the people that I consider friends I don’t really see after work ends.."

594,"I haven't been to leave the house in months almost. I've been laying in the darkness for far too long in pain and suffering over remorse and guilt over everything.

I usually just apply pointless tasks in my life such as playing games that don't require much thinking or staring at a blank wall silently due to shame. 

Its just everything I do now reminds me of something bad. I can't live my life normally I just wish there was a way religiously. I'm not depressed but the way I live is extremely depressing and pointless. I have no idea what I'm doing in life. I feel sad and tired.

Can someone give me advice because at this point why am I not dead if everything is pointless? Maybe this is my punishment but all I think about is dying cause I don't have interest in life anymore. I've lost all ambitions I don't even know how my mind isn't depressed because if my mood was depression I might kill myself. So I guess thankfully I'm not depressed.

It's very rare to find someone who would meet their requirements and who they would approve of. I've been wanting to get married for a while but I was told to focus on my studies & now my career. It's been affecting my mental health because I want a partner & I feel like I have no one.

I don't want to sound desperate but I've had a lot of patience when it comes to marriage (I'm heading towards my 30s) & I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to get married as soon as possible.

604,"As Salam Alaykum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh respected brothers and sisters,

I approach you with a humble and seeking heart, yearning for guidance and insight into a concern that has been occupying my thoughts and emotions recently. I have been blessed to be part of the Ummah since birth, Alhamdulillah, due to my devoted Muslim parents, and I have been engaging in Salah for the past 15 years.

Recently, I have found myself engulfed in a state of spiritual numbness, where my connection to the Divine seems to be fading. My prayers are becoming infrequent, and, much to my dismay, even the blessed Jummah is being neglected. I find myself lost in this drift, well aware of the fact that this negligence is not only wrong but also detrimental to my spiritual wellbeing. No matter the extent of my endeavors, reverting back to my previous state of devotion seems to be an unattainable feat, and it is deeply troubling.

I am starting to contemplate whether this spiritual decline might be correlated with my intensified focus on my professional commitments. The workload and the pursuit of worldly achievements seem to overshadow my spiritual duties, leaving me in a constant battle between my responsibilities towards Allah (SWT) and my professional aspirations.

I seek your valued advice, your wisdom, and your experience in guiding me back to the path of devoted Islam. My heart knows this is the righteous and true way, and I ardently desire to revitalize my Iman and deepen my connection with Allah (SWT). Could you kindly recommend what I should read, who I should listen to, and what steps I should undertake to navigate my way back to steadfastness and unwavering faith? Are there specific supplications, verses, or Hadiths that could illuminate my path in this period of spiritual darkness? Are there particular scholars or lectures that could provide the necessary spiritual nourishment and guidance to rekindle the flame of faith within my heart?

Moreover, I would be immensely grateful for any personal reflections or experiences that you could share regarding overcoming similar phases of spiritual stagnation. Your insights would be a source of inspiration and a beacon of light in my ongoing journey to reclaim my spiritual essence and revitalize my commitment to the teachings of Islam.

May Allah (SWT) bless you all for your time, consideration, and support"

1. basically, my mother covers her hair and prays, etc,.

another reason is probably because the country we are in is southeast asian, meaning there are born muslims who are unaware of rulings and tend to follow “culture”. (i’m not calling my mother one! of course i don’t know whats in her heart, i’m just saying its very normalized here) 

usually my father (who was a revert Alhamdulillah) would be the one who would advise/remind her about islamic things, but now they aren’t together, so what can i do or say? i started becoming a practicing muslim only fairly recently Alhamdulillah, so some of my family (like my older brother) have thought that i’m being too “extreme” when it comes to rules n stuff… (not his exact words but in shaa Allah ykwim)

2. another problem i have is freemixing with cousins. in shaa Allah, i try my best to wear hijab infront of them Alhamdulillah, but what about freemixing and being together? my family likes to “bond” by going to restaurants together, having roadtrips together, etc. would it still be wrong for me to freemix with my cousins if i, in shaa Allah, would have hijab on?"

I have this issue at home. Growing up I’ve never seen my parents pray 5 times, and thought prayer was just a voluntary act that you can do if you want to. But I remember we never missed the Friday prayer. 

When I started using social media when I was 14-15, I realised how important 5 prayers are and I tried to pray as much as possible. I wasn’t as consistent. 
However, since a few years I’ve started to pray more consistently and gotten closer to Allah. My mother tries her best too. 
But my father doesn’t. It hurts me seeing him not pray. He has been advised by his mother, father and siblings to pray as they pray all the Salah. 
He gets irritated and angry and says to everyone “I will go in my own grave with my a’mal, leave my life to it, Allah is forgiving”. 
I’ve not had the guts to tell him even though he sees me pray in front of him. Out of respect I don’t want him to feel even more embarrassed. 

What do I do please help it hurts seeing him not pray😞😞

JazakAllah Khair"
620,"I, currently 14-15M, am, Alhamdulillah, an improving Muslim, and would like to tell the future parents, or current parents more specifically on how to guide their children to Islam.

When I was young, I was fond of Islam and would pray and read the Quran on my own without anyone telling me to do so. As I grew up and shifted countries, I dont get the good vibes when praying anymore and also bcz of time difference and had almost completely lost myself to many harams (including leaving prayer completely).


Now, I have become fond of learning and implementing Islam once again in my life, but my parents hold me back. From an early age, I heard my elder siblings be constantly abused physically and mentally, by our parents telling them that theyre ""useless"" ""lucky to not be on the streets"" ""have less knowledge and determination than an illiterate boy"" ""will not enter Jannah if you dont do so and so"". They made them read Quran and pray like chores and responsibilities. I do agree that they are our responsibilities, but whats the point of forcing someone Islam? 


Its like forcing them a food they dont like to make them despise/move away from it even more.


I recently went through a Islamic awakening of a sort and wanted to change my life for the better, and I am growing a Sunnah beard.


But I cant help it anymore. Before I even hear the Azaan, I will hear my parents scold everyone 
""You guys are worth nothing! Be lucky Allah has given you what you have and at least pray, because you dont deserve any of it. 30 years of my life ive been yelling at the top of my lungs and you guys still dont pray"".

And for me "" Just cut the beard if you cant even pray on time ""

I keep the beard as a reminder, that I am workingg to improve myself. Not to show that I AM good or perfect, or that I always pray on time and am so pure and innocent.



Parents, if you want your child to be Islamic, NEVER NAG AT THEM.

If you want them to be Islamic, in their early childhood, never bring them close to music, rather make them listen to the Quran and tell them stories of the Prophet Muhammed PBUH and the Companions.


When they grow older and, (may Allah prevent it from happening) and dont pray or read Quran, sit down with them. CALMLY ask them why they didnt pray, or if they did. And tell them not to lie, and if they havent prayed, tell them to go pray because it is better to tell the truth and pray late rather than lying and not praying at all.

Do not force them to read Quran like a chore such as ""If you dont read __ number of Rukooh today you cant play any games"".

Thats outrageous. What do you think they will do after youre gone? Ask them to read the Quran, maybe even 1 page a day. And only tell them once or twice in a WHOLE DAY (same for prayers). The more you nag them the more they move away.


(Also guys this is kind of a rant i guess, but parents please be advised!)"
621,"السلام عليكم 


I am looking for any reliable app or website that has accurate times for prayer. My Dad and I have conflicting results from what we use, and I suspect it’s either to do with host website or that it is rounding time by a couple of minutes in my region. 

Many thanks in advance!"
622,Same as the title. For example I joined the imam in anyy rakah other than the first. Normally when imam does salaam to the left and right I stand up but what if imam does prostration of forgetfulness.

EDIT: Reading the comments, you have given me Stuff like videos or to read the Quran, I want to say Thank you for them ideas, And I do apologise as it is very unlikely I will be Muslim, but Again Thank you for the comments, May Allah guide you all 🙏"
626,"I made an in depth guide on my YouTube channel to help other Muslims start praying 5x a day. The video covers common excuses/reasons of Muslims who don't pray that the shaytaan has convinced them are sufficient  n them neglecting their salat. Astagfirullah, May Allah protect us all. It also gives them more/stronger reasons for why they should pray to motivate them and to make them more fearful of the punishment of Allah. If you're reading this and you don't pray, I strongly advise that you watch my video and in sha allah it helps you, it is quite a lengthy video but worry not, you can skip to the chapters most relevant to you. And if you're watching this and you do pray 5x a day, then please share this video to your family and friends who don't/are struggling to so they may be of benefit. May Allah make us all steadfast on our salat!! Ameen."

628,"I recently started working with a Quran teacher and have been reciting to her almost every day over the summer. But after I started school is was hard to keep up with everything and I returned to cheating while reciting. I would review before but I’d get so nervous so I would look at the mushaf while reciting. I feel really bad about it but I can’t bring it up because I’ll get in huge trouble for that. The good thing is that I am actually reviewing and could try to keep up but I need a slower pace rn, but the bad thing is… it’s still cheating.

Any tips on how I can break that habit of returning to the wrong thing when I’m stressed, and any revision tips I can get. ( revising isn’t hard for me but at times, the chapter itself can be difficult. I just go over each ayah a bunch of times, read tafseer, and listen as well. I think it’s that i probably need to almost rememorize the chapter, but I can’t say that). Thanks."

3. are there any branches of islam like there is orthodox for christianity

631,"I've just started my final year of university and I left home about two weeks ago. When I lived at home, my mum would wake me up for fajr but now that I'm alone, it's my responsibility of course. I've been having trouble waking up and I feel so disappointed in myself. I've done everything I can to try and fix the situation like moving my phone away from my nightstand and to a my desk so I have to physically get up and turn it off, setting multiple alarms, keeping my blinds open so worse comes to worst, the natural light will wake me up, but nothing seems to work and I keep missing Fajr. 

There have been days where I've woken up and prayed fajr but I've really had to force myself. This morning I left my phone on my desk and I woke up to find it next to me on my nightstand - I have no recollection of even hearing my alarm let alone getting up to turn it off.

I've had a very rough 3 months or so, so I'm attributing it with that (no idea if that's actually the case or not) but it's really uncharacteristic of me - I usually always wake up of my own accord even without an alarm and am very good at getting up for fajr, this has never happened before and the fact that everything I do is having essentially no benefit is making me so upset and I feel like an awful Muslim. 

There are a lot of days where I wake up, go to turn off my alarm and then just head back to sleep because I'm so exhausted and I just kind of do it on autopilot without thinking and that brings me so much pain."

عَنْ أَبِي سَعِيدٍ الْخُدْرِيِّ أَنَّ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ مَنْ قَرَأَ سُورَةَ الْكَهْفِ فِي يَوْمِ الْجُمُعَةِ أَضَاءَ لَهُ مِنَ النُّورِ مَا بَيْنَ الْجُمُعَتَيْنِ

My question is, I've liked video editing and streaming for fun and is it okay to have them in the background or is it Haram to use them like this?
Thank you for any response, have a great day!"
637,"I need an actual source for the asnwer to this question, not just any ""oh its actually..."" like someone send islamic sources or something because this question is extremely contreversial lately.  


Lets consider an example that someone has an extremely abusive mother or father, and i mean, ABUSIVE. Like, they are mentally insane and should never have had children. They starve their child, yell at them for asking for any help, never appreciate what their children do, just overall treat their children like literal garbage. (and yes, this does happen is some households, especially in Muslim asian households where not getting an A in literally any subject is considered a crime and the parents are drug addicts of some kind)  


in a situation like that, is it sinful for the child to steal from their parents and run away? like, use their parents money to start up a new life and all. some people even start considering suicide in cases like these, and i just dont understand why Allah, the most merciful and forgiving, would send someone stuck in a situation like that to hell for committing suicide either.  


idk what it is, most probably waswasas, but a few aspects of islamic beliefs just dont suit the merciful image that Allah is meant to have. For example, what if there is a non Muslim person who gets kidnapped and tortured till death. Even though they went though they went through so much pain, would Allah still send them to hell for not knowing about Islam?

A couple minutes before writing this, I was shedding a couple tears because this is truly one of the saddest things I've ever heard. 95% of my friends are atheist, so is my dad and my other siblings. The thought that my friends and/or loved ones could even be tortured in Jahannam for a second killed me. I don't know what to do. I am mostly just trying to talk to somebody about it because I'm pretty sure you guys can imagine what it'd feel like to know that the person who raised you and more than half of the people you know might go to hell.

649,"Assalamualaikum everyone, i hope everyone has a blessed friday

Before friday prayer today, my closed friend called me for support and when i came to his dorm, he was crying his heart out to my shoulder.

He had a pretty rough childhood and what happened today really shook him to the brink of suicide, long story short he had his graduation from uni on wednesday and thursday, and his parents and family can't come because of other business outside of town (his parents doesn't live in the same town as his uni), so i was the one that accompany him. And yesterday his parents finally come but in a really sour mood, making his graduation almost unbearable.

Today he still have some things to do with the uni, bureaucracy and all that before he finally officially graduates, then had a fight with his parents. He needs a few more days before he can come back home, but his parents (father especially) thinks that he's there to party, to have fun and not wanting to go home, then his father kept rambling to the point of degrading him.

His parents never show to him that they're proud, even though he picked this uni because his father refused to let him go to his dream uni even though he was already accepted to said dream uni, then even after he got cumlaude, his parents still don't show any sense of pride.

After piling this up, and with that fight, he finally snapped and cried to my shoulder and say that ""i'm nothing but a burden to my family"" and that "" i should kill myself."" I comfort him and say that he's a strong human and that Allah will never abandon him if he is patience, but he said ""i've been patience for years now, how long should i keep this until my parents are proud of me?""

He calmed down for now and we went to friday prayers, but i would like to ask, what should he do? i do not want to lose him and i do believe after all this hardship, Allah will grant ease. But seeing him holding all this and finally broke today broke my heart. Any advice for him?

TL:DR: family problem from years broke my friend today and he wants to commit suicide, any advice?

It’s my understanding that Islamic Scholars are extremely educated in Islam but these scholars are not prophets nor are they members of the sahabah so why do they get to determine what’s haram and what’s not? I ask this question out of genuine curiosity I was never really taught the whole idea behind islamic scholars, i also have noticed a lot of these new islamic scholars have some questionable viewpoints so i’m interested to hear everyone’s opinion.

For me i understand that sex before marriage is haram and worth receiving 100 lashes.

I’m working on myself to improve my Islamic knowledge and trying to become a better Muslim everyday.

I’m in Pakistan for a month and I was listening to this one Imam in the mosque.

He said that your faith isn’t fully completed until you love PBUH Mohammed (peace be upon him) more than anything in this life. This includes your parents, kids or anything else.

Here is the Hadith - “Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “None of you have faith until I am more beloved to him than his children, his father, and all of the people.”

657,"I am a 16 (almost 17) year old female. Both my parents are very strict about me staying in the Catholic faith, but personally, I know I don't belong. I grew up in Christianity all my life, along with my siblings. Both my siblings know that I've been interested in Islam, I've spoken about it with them and they don't care, their biggest concern is me being comfortable and happy with myself. They would rather me be who I am even if it meant my parents didn't like it. I have brought up to my mom (never to my dad) that I might marry/date out of the Catholic religion, and as soon as she heard that she began to get very upset (yelling and arguing with me). At that moment I felt like nothing. My dad has spoken to one of my family friends in the past, these are his exact words ""I don't care what my kids are or what they want to be, as long as they are happy then I am happy as well."" Even though my dad has said it to other people he has never told me it was okay. Don't get me wrong my parents are amazing, they've provided for me all my life and supported me through things that they aren't always happy about. I don't know if it's the idea of me converting or marrying out of 'my' religion and race. It crosses my mind every day and I honestly feel so bad, I have to choose between my own happiness or pleasing my parents. When I compare it like that I honestly just have to think about my own happiness and do what I want to do. Sometimes I think of just converting and committing to what I want to do instead of always thinking about how my parents feel and want. Some more background on me is I always try and please my parents, with my grades, how I dress, and even my daily routines. I sometimes even let my parents choose my clothes because I am scared that they won't like it. It's not that I've done anything wrong or they think I am making a bad choice, I genuinely think they don't like the idea of me like that. It makes me sad, everything I do is for my parents, when I was young I had to mature very quickly. I genuinely need some advice, anything and everything will help."

For example a person who feeds the homeless genuinely because they want to help them and ease their burdens will not be rewarded for that unless they do it with the intention of pleasing Allah? Or is it like if they do the good deed but are more worried about how the deed is perceived by people rather then Allah then it wouldn’t count?

665,"hi everyone. I was in a relationship with a muslim girl for a little bit and we ended things. The two biggest decisions were the long distance and being in a haram relationship, it didn't line up with her values and her religious, which I respect. Obviously, being the non-religious in that relationship, I am heart broken and it was not an easy conversation. My minds been racing and it gets really dark, really fast. I'm just asking for a bit of advice from other fellow muslims and Islam was something I always wanted to look into but I'm not sure where to start, how to pray, and how to interact with other Muslims. Being a modern man with piercings, a lot tattoos, and not taking care of myself in a spiritual aspect has really made it hard for me. I grew up as a catholic and as I got older, my faith has slowly decreased, and as harsh as it seems, it has been fully dead for a long time now. I ask for some guidance alhamdulillah. Anything would help. Thank you"
666,"Assalamu Alaikum guys. As you can see in the title these days I became sick because of extreme fear of fainting, becoming nothing, losing consciousness, and pure darkness after death. I also have doubts about Islam like ""what if afterlife doesn't exist?"" or ""what if Allah doesn't exist?"" which I am trying to forget and not to think about it but I can't get out of my head. I am getting these thoughts since I started doing salah. I used to be %100 sure about Islam before starting salah. When I started salah I started to have doubts about islam which I usually ignored but soon these doubts growed which is now controlling my mind. I can't do anything right now, I can't go to school, I am only thinking about death and I am still teen who goes to highschool. I am also having panic attacks because I sometimes think we will be nothing after we die which makes me extremely sad I hope it's wrong. I am also scared that my faith is not valid because I have doubts which makes me feel like I am doomed from each side. Someone please soothe me by giving proofs about Islam and afterlife. Please someone help me I am going to be crazy

UPDATE: I appreciate you guys for showing proofs of Islam and afterlife (I am still reading them) but some of you saying ""even afterlife didn't exists, you would be unconscious and you wouldn't feel"" and that's the problem. I don't want to be unconscious FOREVER. I just don't want to experience it. Sleeping forever without seeing any dreams is the worst thing in my life What's the meaning of having fun or praying if we all gonna die somehow and if there's nothing after death. And this so-called ""Science"" trying to force me to believe that we are only made out of atoms and then we will turn into dust when we die makes even more sad. I am truly sorry for making you guys busy with my problem but I have no were else to reach.🥺(Thanks for the support) Also please share your miraculous experiences like near-death experiences or miracles ect. cause that really soothes me."

669,"Young Muslim boys and girls showing their admiration for the Holy Prophet (saw). 
"
670,"I will try to explain my point in depth for you guys to get what I mean by it doesn't make sense. 

Firstly, Allah creates us already knowing and writing the events of our entire life, out actions, the poeol we meet, the things we will think, rn I am writing this message but it was already written before I was even a project in my parents mind that at sole point down the line I would be writing this exact post and have this exact doubt at this exact moment. Everything we do, have done and will do were already decided before we were even created. Which means that even if you think something is from your decision, it never is and will never be since it was already written for you to do. 

Secondly, the very concept of Hell and Heaven shouldn't be a thing, because as stared earlier Allah creates us with all our deeds and actions already planned, which means that Allah would be creating people specifically to go to hell and others to go to heaven. But the whole point of this dunya is to earn our place there, but if we are already written to do what we do we don't really do anything, we are just bunch of marionettes of flesh and blood following a script that have been written before even being created.

Thirdly, I have seen some scholars saying that perhaps Allah has left sole thing unwritten for us to make our own choices. Sure, but it doesn't make sense, because Allah being all knowing, he already knows what choice we will do, and as such, even if it isn't written, it still isn't completely our choice since it was already in Allah's plan that we woul react that way.

Fourthly, when I was a kid and still trying to make sense of it, I was like ""Maybe what they mean by all-knowing is that he is aware of all the possibilities but not the exact one that accures, the sake way they say Allah has two Right hand when in reality it is just a metaphor to say he is righteous"" but the thing is that thinking that way even if it solves the freewill problem, creates a whole new problem which is the fact that with this line of thinking that would mean Allah is in fact not actually a 100% all knowing, or that's not permissible and the simple fact saying that though out loud makes makes le think I will be cursed. So scrap that idea, and back to square one. 

I can contort my brain in every direction imaginable, and I still don't have any way of figurines this one out, maybe I don't see the whole picture and there is something I didn't see. But this idea is driving me crazy and I still haven't found one single thing or person that would solve this for me. Freewill simply does not make any sense"
671,"So I want to listen to Quran a bit more, bit the struggle I find is that:
1) I need to be completely focused when listening cause I don't like just putting Quran as background noise
2) Most recitations are the same and I end up being bored from listening

Recently I came across two recitations that caught my attention. The first one being by a guy called Omar Hisham, I don't know how to describe it better than his recitations sounds lire melodic than the usual recitations I listen to, though I don't know if it is okay to listen to these types of recitations cause some of my friends told me it sounded a bit too much like singing.

Also, there are those recitations that have a much calmer and slower pace, that I find really calming and mind easing, but I only listened to them in random videos that never showed who the reciters were, so I have no clue who to look for in this."
672,"Assalamu Alaikum,

For the past three years or so, my home life has been horrible. I've made dua to Allah asking him to make things better nearly every single day, but they never get better. I come home and its the same thing everyday. I'll be moving out soon, and I've just been feeling a little angry and upset because all the time I've been at home, he never made the hardship stop. I don't want to have to move out. I want to stay at home and have a nice place to come home to like everyone else, but I don't know how much longer I can take this. I have to leave. I feel like I'm going to look back on this in the future and think about how I suffered for years and Allah never helped me even though I asked him to. It took me leaving my own home to make things stop. I'm not the best Muslim by no means, but I thought Allah was merciful. Why didn't he help me?"
673,"I'm from America, but I have worked in Jordan, Palestine and Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years. I have spoken to many devout Muslims about this, and they say that the oldest language is Arabic.

2) What is the basis from which this notion arises? Something in Quran? Hadith? Other?"

Over the last couple of years I have come to really love Islam, and made friends with lots of friends who have helped me learn more and more and eventually say my shahada a little ways into year 11. Alhamdulillah Allah led me at a young age to find him and learn slowly and carefully over the years.

I have to admit here that the only thing that I still struggle with is to put my hijab. I feel this immense sense of guilt knowing Allah has commanded me, but it's been years and I don't think I will ever be able to wear it with contentment and acceptance, nevermind actually liking it. I have heard all the scholarly arguments, feel the guilt, and still there's a part of me that says 'Allah didn't mean confining you to this when he said to cover your adornments.' Like I'm trying to re-analyze the text, and kind of convincing myself? Or gaslighting myself?

I feel like a fraud and a weirdo to even voice this, maybe this isn't the right place, and it's so hard now that I've moved to university in a place where there aren't many muslims, nevermind hijabi girls who may be able to help me see it a different way - although my high school friends did try.

687,"Hi all,

I'm in a little bit of a predicament and I'm not sure what to do. 

Back story: my dad (Muslim) and my mum (born Muslim but considers herself Christian) raised me and my siblings with not much religion. We knew we were Muslim, but were never really taught how to pray etc until my dad got a little more religious after a health scare. Even then, nothing was ever forced upon us and we pretty much learn everything from friends and school. 

All my siblings now are adults, and have a good relationship.with our parents (we all live together). My sister is definitely more islamic and I consider myself quite islamic too but keep my faith to myself. I'm not a perfect Muslim but love the religion and what it teaches me. Because of this, my mum considers me to be the open minded one and has badmouthed islam to me. When she does it, I stay silent and just leave the room whenever I can. I usually end up crying my eyes out because mother's have so much respect in our religion but the words that come out of her mouth make me dislike her so much. 

There have been occasions where I've tried to talk to her but she is very ignorant. Earlier today, she talked about how she would like to start going to church and if I could drop her off. Honestly, the thought of it terrifies me as I don't know if I would get sinned for it. She then went on to tell me how she's had dreams where she had Arabic being said into her ear and that experience has confirmed to her that Islam is a bad thing. Even though there are also Arab Christians who speak Arabic. She carried on talking about how I should look to Jesus and she hopes I come to Christianity one day. Then she said 'things might look nice from the surface but as soon as you dig deeper, there's filth everywhere'. That comment stung and I could feel myself on the brink of tears. I changed the topic and walked out the room. 

I really don't know what to do. If I answer back or respectfully tell her that I'm more than happy I'm Muslim, it results in arguments or her getting annoyed with me. But if I keep quiet and just let the comment pass, I feel broken. 

Has anyone got some advice for me? It would be much appreciated."
688,"Assalam u Alaikum everyone. Me and my family have been dealing wih alot of stress. For as long as i can remember my family has been in trials. Firstly it was when i was 5 yo my house got attacked by jinns. They would try to kills us by doing horrible stuff it’s all just so traumatising. And that continued to happen for 7 or 8 years. We had to sell out house moved to because we would have to continually change house so that maybe would leave us alas they did it one point also because my dad is schizophrenic and he didn’t like neighbours and tried to harm himself and others( hes better now but not good) and then we bought a house again and lost it again because of bad decisions in business made by my brother. Now we’re again on rent and my father is retiring soon. And i have no idea what is going to happen in future because hes only breadwinner.And my brother is causing alot if problems He has cheated everybody almost and makes reckless decisions that would make him end going to prison and he’s just so evil but when he sees consequences of his actions he cries asks for forgiveness from Allah and also from my parents he has broken their hearts they’re so worried and humiliated and degraded everyday because of him. And they forgive him when they see him crying or begging for forgiveness. But he again falls in those evil ways of his again amd again . He curses swears , cheats people in money and also steals from us. And my education is now in jeopardy because of his loans that he took without telling us. We had to sell almost everything because of him. I hate him so much. He takes humongous amounts of loans and makes promises to give them but doesn’t and people come to the house to degrade my father and my father is already a patient. And my mother is also a highblood pressure patient. Her health is also deteriorating. My brother even cheated my relatives. And then all the ties have been cut off because of him. And everyone blames my parents. Doesn’t work because not educated enough. And he’s also the biggest biggest everrrrrr liar. Every minute he lies to us. And when situations gets too worse when people say they are coming to beat him or make him disappear he tries to attempt suicide every damn time we have to save him because my parents at the same time can’t live without him. Because they also say because of my father’s illness my father was unfortunately was not able to be there to protect him from the bad company when he was little. He would run away when my father had mania attacks. What do we do please give me some advice. 
Sorry this is so long."
689,"Few weeks back, while my mom was cleaning she found a chit under the stairs. the chit was folded tightly and in the chit these were some sort of table and inside that table there were some random Arabic numbers and some Arabic letters and words too. I could recognise only two words one being my mom’s name and other was my grandmother’s. Few days after this discovery my mom started having breathing issue she could not breath properly some sort of shortness of breath. We got all the reports and everything was clear my mom took medicines for two weeks nothing seemed to workout so my dad and mom went to a guy (a guy my dad already knows) they told them everything however before telling about the breathing problem that guy already told my mom that she has breathing problem. He told them there is some sort of Ilm or taweez on her and her whole house and gave my mom some chits and said to keep these chits in water and drink that water my mom did everything as he said. He also asked my dad to call him again tomorrow to get updates as he said he will be doing istkhara or something tonight. 
The other day he told my dad that it’s confirmed that there is some ilm or taweez upon the house which is not good and if we want he will get some equipment from the city and that will help us get rid of this. my dad said okay go on.
The next day my mom and dad go to the guy and he showed them 5 more chits again folded tightly and burnt from sides the chits were folded in a different way. The five chits had human like faces drawn and some sort or positive and negative symbols on checks and also some cross signs. He told them to keep these chits in water whole night and in the morning throw these in water before sunrise.
While my mom had this problem we all obviously prayed for her too. I used to pray for her in Tahajjud too.
I don’t know how they do these taweez and everything is it okay in Islam? what does Islam say about this? Please acknowledge me whatever you know as I’m exploring this…

694,"السلام عليكم ورحمه الله وبركاته 

I’ve been Muslim for years, and one of the struggles is finding halal meat. The halal market is a long drive away and online is much more expensive. I follow a pretty strict diet, and have avoided meat and fast food, however I’ve started looking more into the issue.

I have been of the opinion that meat in the West is haram, because slaughtering rules, and it could be atheists and others slaughtering it.  That only buying halal marked meat was halal. However, while I do not believe all meat to be halal, I believe that cow could be slaughtered ok. The problem I feel with this thinking is that it leads to extreme measures in fiqh and Taqwa. It makes lots of food haram and eventually has no basis. Now obviously if you lived in a pure Buddhist country, this would apply. 



I saw an opinion from many scholars that eating meat in the West is halal because the people there are Ahlul-Kitab . It also says eating at restaurants like Burger King is halal. With organic, it’s probably safe. I’m not sure what to really believe."

696,"So i got a cat a few days ago and he’s been using the litter just fine. However we only got one box so have had to either move it in my room or in the living room depending on whether the cats upstairs or downstairs as it spends most of the day in my room so i can watch him then the evening downstairs so it gets moved accordingly. However tonight the cat went and peed in the box, then got up and peed in the corner of the room on my shoes literally seconds later?
Obviously this was quite frustrating but i rinsed my shoes in the sink and wiped the floor down a few times. However the cat did run around after peeing and i saw a few paw prints from the pee, i wiped what i could see but my flooring is dark so i’m worried that even after i washed myself after this incident im dirty after walking on the floor as there may be parts i missed. So i’m worried if my salat would be accepted? from an islamic pov do i have to keep cleaning even after i cleaned what was visible? Also the litter was put in a few days ago but i did notice it looked a bit wet so i m will change it tomorrow but idk if that was the cause of the problem 

Also worried the cat will pee on a carpet downstairs or something as luckily the flooring is wooden in my room but that’s not the case downstairs so will be more of an issue. Just really don’t know what to do and i’m worried this will become a regular thing and i just want to be able to enjoy my cat🙁

699,"From what I understand, the Sahih hadith rely a lot upon oral transmissions from people known to be trustworthy + had good memory. But this to me is confusing because the Sahih rated hadith authors weren't born early enough to be able to ridicule and verify the claims of the narrators. How could they have verified any hadith? If I had to guess, they probably got their hadith and chain of narrations from other books. But, they would still have to verify those books and essentially derive their hadith from a single person who claims to have known actual hadith. Even if those books came from a ""trustworthy"" person, verification is still needed."

701,"Recently I heard an argument from someone which basically went along the lines of: 

If according to Allah's 99 names, He is merciful, and these names have always been the names of Allah, then how could He have shown mercy before creation began? Since showing mercy is transactional, then Allah would be dependant upon creation to have this attribute. According to the arguer, Allah being dependant upon creation for His attributes and His ability to convey them, would goes against Allah's other attribute of being independant of creation for His attributes, (al-Qiyamu bin-Nafs). 

I was wondering if there's any flaws/untruths in this thought process or refutations to the argument?"
702,"If Allah already has everything planned for us, why are we encouraged to pray and ask him for things we want? Because surely if he has a plan for us, and he answers our duas, it’ll be going against his original plan?

Then he (Gabriel) calls out in heaven, saying: Allah loves So-and-so, therefore love him. And the inhabitants of heaven love him. He (the Prophet pbuh) said: Then acceptance is established for him on earth. And if Allah has abhorred a servant [of His], He calls Gabriel and says: I abhor So-and-so, therefore abhor him.

Now this isn’t me generalizing or stereotyping but I have heard from multiple hijabis that latinas have issues with them and the reasons why. 

Anyway, I thought let me continue trying to be nice and friendly to her until I couldn’t anymore and just pretended she doesn’t exist because she’s too mean lol. I started 6 weeks ago and after a week there, she went on vacation and should be back next week. Question is, I know as Muslims we have to be kind, and remain kind, but where’s the line? Should I continue being friendly with her in the hopes that she’ll come to change her stupid way with me? I genuinely don’t care about her one bit but only asking because I don’t need any tension at the workplace. Where’s the line between staying kind and being rude back to her? Islamic perspective based answers only please."
726,"Salam Alaikum

I recently went to a doctor for a tumor in my breast, they say it grew and that if I don’t remove it, it could turn into a cancer. They also say the surgery could cause damage to my milk ducts and if I plan on any kids, I might not be able to breast feed. I’ve always wanted to be a mom. I’m very stressed. 

They don’t know if the tumor caused any prior damage. There’s no way to find out until after the surgery. 

I’m very stressed about it. 

Thank you"
727,"Salam everyone. 

I have had this on my mind for a long time. Growing up my family were not practising Muslims and we were brought up to be known as Ahmadis. We would only go for Eid prayer. Despite being born into it where we have all uncles and aunts that are Ahmadi, neither my parents or brothers believed in it or practised it.

As years went on and knowledge was gained, as a family we all did our shahadah and accepted islam and completely left Ahmadiyyat.

During COVID-19 my mother passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. This was the most heartbreaking experience of my life. We had to prepare a janazah within a day. As mentioned majority of the family are ahmadi so there was a lot of division on who lead the janazah. It was in a park because of mosques being closed due to restrictions.

There was a lot of pressure on myself to make decisions on who lead the prayer. Their imam ended up reading it to prevent divisions and I feel guilt to this every single day of my life because as I mature and understand islam more and more, I live with regret despite I was barely 20 when she passed away and wanted to keep everyone together and was unaware that they're classed as non-muslims (I always had the mentality to assume Allah will forgive, guide and accept any sort of islam within them).

My questions are, would this have even be accepted? Will I be held responsible for this?

PS. If there's anyone in a similar situation of leaving this sect and would like to talk or know more about it to educate themselves, feel free to message me as growing up we've had a lot of exposure to their community, gatherings and mentality.

Jazakallah"

732,"Hey. 24 y/o female here with generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. I have healthy anxiety concerning the sun because I get burnt easily and I have to always wear it. However, I often have a hard time removing it when I want to perform wudu and removing it takes up to 40mins sometimes because I apply coconut oil then wash with another soap to really make sure I removed everything and so that water can reach my skin well. (my OCD does not help in this case). This is causing me great hardship and is hindering my ability to leave the house, pray outside the house and even find a job. And I cannot perform wudu and then apply it because I have gas incontinence, so I have to perform a separate wudu for each prayer. Any help/knowledge concerning this topic would be much appreciated. + any sunscreen recommendations that are wudu friendly and that are not water-resistant+halal ingredients would be much appreciated as well."

I hope you're all doing well. I recently reverted to Islam and am embarking on this beautiful journey. While I'm excited, I also understand that there's a lot to learn and absorb. That's where I'm hoping you can lend a helping hand.

I'm eager to hear from you all. What advice would you give to someone who's new to Islam? Whether it's about daily practices, understanding the Quran, I'm all ears.

Please share your wisdom, recommended resources, and any personal experiences that might help me on this path. I truly appreciate any guidance you can offer.

Thank you in advance for your support and kind words."
734,"Salam! I (19F) have a close non-muslim friend (19F) and she just informed me that she plans on meeting with a guy she’s been talking to for months online. I reverted to Islam this year and she’s been with me throughout the journey. We discuss religion quite often, and she’s firm on the oneness of God and I see that she grasps it. Still, it is Allah who guides and all I can do is give dawah and pray. 

He’s coming to see her soon to meet and hangout. Before, she had marriage in mind and says that she still does—but she wants to meet him personally. I urged her to have him speak to her father first but unfortunately she comes from a dysfunctional family and does not want him to meet her father nor mother. She says she just needs to meet him and experience this without her family knowing. I keep viewing it from an Islamic point of view, which is why it’s concerning me. I think she understands that this isn’t the right way of going about things, but she insists.

I really want the best for her, she is like a sister to me. But she is settled on this decision and is meeting him regardless. All I can do is advise based on the little information that I have. Idk what else I can do besides making dua for her."

I personally don’t see a issue but I am a revert so my thinking could be biased even when not trying to be if you get me but to iterate on my idea I don’t think god doesn’t particularly cares about the methods of prayer as long as you don’t do the other versions out pride or laziness and you submit to him

So a side question would be is convenience laziness or just what’s easier for you to do? in this situation since Muslims states the other two religions are valid but the message has been corrupted does that also refer to their prayer form Im just assuming there’s nothing on it and corruption wasn’t referring to the pray style please send me your rebuttals good gentleman and ladies"

Riba here is defined as an increase in quantity which makes no sense when talking about fiat currency. This fatwa  is the mainstream and i find it not only unrealistic, but also unfair for the lender. Fiat currency is valued by its purchasing power, not by its quantity, and the government can choose to devalue the currency by printing money out of thin air. Look at Zimbabwe, Venezuela,  Argentina, Lebanon, etc.

No sane person would lend anyone if the money would be returned with less purchasing power. In addition, the borrower could delay the payment to take advantage of inflation. Isn't the reason Riba is haram is to prevent the oppression of the borrower? The alternative the Sheikhs are advocating for oppresses the lender (and is unrealistic since no one would lend). What makes sense is that the borrower should return the money equivalent to the same purchasing power during the lending time.

The Sheikhs are applying an Islamic principle to a non-Islamic  finanicial system resulting in an unrealistic mess. All currencies are  Riba based since money is created via the fractional reserve banking system, where the bank could lend 10 times the amount of the deposits. This system is inherently inflationary. This is totally different from the financial system 1400 years ago.

What would i define as Riba then? if the money lent is returned with a greater purchasing power. this was the case 1400 years ago. Nowadays, receiving interest doesn't necessary mean the purchasing power increased.

The misconception here stems from basing Fiat currency on gold. 1400 years ago, an increase in quantity necessarily meant an increase in purchasing power hence there was no need for distinction between quantity and purchasing power. Introducing money printing to the equation creates a distinction.

Edit: Typos."

751,"For context, I'm 19M, in my 2nd year of college. Things have been getting harder lately because nobody is chaste like me. Everyone either is in a relationship or either had sex already. My sexual desires are at their peak and it's ULTRA HARD to stay patient. Allah SWT says in the quran that zina is haram and everything, but why? What is the point of it today? Nobody wants to get married, everyone goes out and commit zina or do some other crap, but they always find a way not to get married! And the worst part: parents are not helping. 

Famous quote from parents: study+money then we'll see.

I absolutely don't want to wait until my late 20s/30yr old to finally do it, it's like if I lose everything from my younger time. I want to fix this issue once and for all, but how? I tried fasting and fasting, no results, it's not helpful. I hate to say this but... maybe this is wrong? Maybe waiting is wrong? I do not want to judge Allah SWT's decisions nor defiy him (that would be out of my mind), but this seems wrong. If somebody can help me find a solution it would be nice.

Also, I do work, I have a part time job, I study in college (2nd year), and I am a believer that does everything a muslim needs to do."

I dont care anymore, I dont care. I’m gonna do my thing, stick to the five pillars of Islam, watch these guys so I can reconnect with the Deen and start ENJOYING again to practise my Deen.

My Question: has anyone performed Umrah on 10/11 hrs layover flight and how did you manage your checked in luggage? (Please specify month and year as their regulations often change )

2nd Question: Did you get visa on arrival or an e-visa? (If e-visa was it tourist or Umrah visa)

My mom has a habit of cursing very bad things when she’s angry, both me and the deen itself which makes me afraid for myself and her because of all her curses.
  She loses control of her tongue in moments of anger. My sister doesn’t get cursed as much as I do. She gets away with nearly anything.
Will making constant dua and asking Allah to not listen to her angry curses/wishes prevent bad stuff from happening?
My mom has a lot depression and health issues so I consider why her internal frustration always blows up on me and not my other siblings.  But at the same time, it’s truly saddening to hear and see all the time. I truly try to be on her good side but everything about me irritates her and it messes with my confidence.

764,"So I have taken an interest in Islam. But there are just so many questions I have. I honestly do not know where to start so I guess I should start here. I am Mexican, would I be able to revert to Islam? I only know English and Spanish…don’t know any Arabic, just a few words. 

I am also afraid of what my family would think and treat me if I revert. They are catholic and although they are very understanding, I am sure they would be very heart broken. My mother always tells me to cross and pray to JC, and I sometimes do it because I feel bad. I love my mother so much I do not want to hurt her. I guess has anyone ever been shunned or excluded? This also leads me to another question. As I mentioned my family is catholic, I kind of grew up catholic. 

However, I never really felt a presence or believed in a creator so when I was 14 y/o (now 27) I stopped practicing Catholicism. I’ve always believed more in evolution, science based facts, things that can be proven. I’ve always wanted to believe, but it’s hard.  Can one practice Islam if they don’t believe in a creator? How can I learn more about Allah?

As for the hijab, I have seen/heard so much on wearing it. Even some Muslims have criticized sisters for not wearing them correctly (showing a small piece of their hairline, but everything else covering). How exactly is one supposed to wear it when even showing a strand of hair is considered haram?  What about in a situation where your job will not let you wear a hijab, not because they are prejudice, but because of safety concerns? Or what if I am not wearing hijab when I get a job, later revert start wearing hijab and they don’t accept it? For example, I am in the process of becoming a correctional officer. They state that for safety reasons, hijab is not allowed because I must be careful with the inmates. In an instance they could use that to their advantage, to cover my face and who knows what they could get away with. Can you practice without having to wear a hijab?

I do also have piercings and tattoos. Tattoos I can not remove. So how can one practice Islam if tattoos are seen as bad?

I also live alone with my two dogs. I have been told that having pets is not allowed unless they are hunting or guard dogs? They are guard dogs, but mostly my family. They keep me happy and are really the only friends I have. I know it sounds so sad, but they truly mean everything to me.

I am sorry for my lack of understanding. I am really confused on a lot of things. I guess I am just scared of being judged and shunned from non-Muslims and Muslims if not practicing correctly. I don’t know where to start and I don’t know if I can even revert because of the few things I mentioned above. 

I am really lost. I’m sorry for these silly questions. Thank you all for taking the time to read this and responding."

It will be said: 'Do you recognize this?' They will say: 'Yes. This is death.' Then it will be laid down and slaughtered.

***Islamic philosophy has greatly affected how people in the West think. This influence started a long time ago and is still felt today. In this article, we will talk about how Islamic philosophy has shaped Western thought and how ImamAI, an app about Islam, helps people learn about this connection.***

**Early Connections:**

Islamic philosophy started to influence Western thought during the Middle Ages. At that time, European scholars began translating the works of Muslim philosophers, like Avicenna and Averroes, from Arabic to Latin. These translations introduced Western thinkers to the ideas of Islamic philosophy, especially how Muslim scholars understood the Greek philosopher Aristotle.

**The Golden Age of Islamic Philosophy:**

Between the 8th and 13th centuries, Islamic philosophers made important contributions to many areas of philosophy. They thought deeply about ethics, religion, and how to reason well. People like Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina, and Al-Ghazali were key figures in this period.

**Sharing Ideas with the West:**

The translation movement in Spain during the 12th and 13th centuries played a big role in spreading Islamic philosophy to the West. Translators took works from Arabic and Greek and made them available in Europe. This brought new ideas to European scholars. Some Western philosophers, like Thomas Aquinas, mixed Islamic ideas with their own thinking.

**Science and Rational Thinking:**

Islamic philosophers also helped develop early science and the way we do scientific research today. Thinkers like Rhazes and Alhazen focused on experiments and observations. These ideas influenced Western science, especially during the Renaissance.

**How ImamAI Helps:**

ImamAI is a modern app that connects Islamic philosophy with today's world. It makes it easy for people to learn about the ideas of Islamic philosophers. The app has a lot of useful features and information. You can explore the works of Islamic scholars and learn about their ideas.

ImamAI helps people connect with Islamic philosophy, religion, and science. It's a great way to learn about this important part of our history.

Islamic philosophy has left a deep mark on Western thinking. From the Middle Ages to today, its ideas have influenced how we understand the world. ImamAI is a helpful tool that makes it easier for people to explore Islamic philosophy and connect it with modern life. Using ImamAI, you can better understand how different cultures and ideas have shaped our world."
781,"Hello brothers and sisters 

Al7amdulilah from ramadan I've been praying but for the last two months I've focused to become a better muslim since I'm a male It's farthd for me to do my prayings in congestions and going to mosque.

My question is that I'm trying to be a better Muslim and do less sins so that inshaallah god will answer my duas 


Am I sinful for that and what's my ruling ?"
782,"“Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves.”

Surah al-Baqarah (222)"
783,"I know some people have doubts but every now and then we get the same question for things we already answered. If you follow the accounts related to such questions, you will see some are brand new made that same day. Some accounts are not in islam sub but in ex-muslim sub.
Every Question or a doubt they come up with has been answered numerous times recently and even long long ago by our scholars. They were answered fully, leaving no trace of doubt behind.
Some ask questions because they don't know where to look for answers but some ask to stir up doubts and fitna. Be ware of those. And to the average muslim who is not learned in the religion and has weak faith, I tell them to refrain from looking into such doubts or listening to sources where they mention such doubt. At least not until they study the religion and strengthen their faith. Some countries don't let their citizens travel to a disease infested place. And if they had too they should take some immunization shots upfront.
The message is be vigilant, learn your religion, strengthen your faith, and be ware of people of fitna.

""They but wish that you should reject faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they)"" Quran 4:89

""Hudhaifa said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be, upon him ) observing: Fitna will be presented to men's hearts as reed mat is woven stick by stick and any heart which is impregnated by them will have a black mark put into it, but any heart which rejects them will have a white mark put in it. The result is that there will become two types of hearts: one white like a white stone which will not be harmed by any turmoil or temptation, so long as the heavens and the earth endure; and the other black and dust-coloured like a vessel which is upset, not recognizing what is good or rejecting what is abominable, but being impregnated with passion."" Muslim sahih.

May Allah protect us from fitan what's clear of it and what is hidden. May Allah keep us steadfast on the path of truth. May Allah aid us to strengthen our faith. Amen."
784,"It was regarding a young guy who sadly passed away in a car accident.

789,"I'm just so tired...

I have helicobacter pylori, not sure how, but I think it's because I drank some dirty water at work (dirty construction work environment), anyways...

If you've never had H. pylori, first of all, say allhamdulillāh, and second of all, it can literally last a *life-time* if not treated consistently and on a strict diet.

It's been around 2 months since I've had it (which feels more like a life-time), and I honestly don't remember the last time that I ate some good food without feeling nauseous and dizzy 30 minutes later.

Please make du'ā for me, I'm just so ####### tired of getting sick and becoming weak for reasons out of my control.

Edit: thank you all for the helpful replies, they won't go unnoticed.

790,"I have been with this man for almost a year. Two months ago I began to find my way back to Islam. I have felt that it is difficult not to sin while in such a relationship. This man knows that I am becoming more of a believer and I want him to end up on the same level as me. Today I wrote a long text in which I specified that we cannot be together if he does not find proper faith. He says that's what he wants, and for weeks that's what he's been saying. When I wrote the message today that we must share the same values ​​and religious views that answer this:

«Yes, I understand what you mean.. and I'm trying to take steps, we share a lot in common and will share more.. at the same time, I think it's easier when you live together and are a married etc... but one thing I have to clarify, that you have respect for each other's pace.. I don't quite agree with you when you say that both MUST share the same vision or it won't work.. I see many examples of that not being true. This should be mainly for oneself.. and when one has brought out the point that you have made now in relation to how you look at it and will have it in the future, then you have delivered the message. I don't need to be reminded of that too often etc.. and I feel that a little too often to be honest.. I need to be allowed to take those steps myself... I'm just as religious as you, maybe a little less .. but as I said, I am working on the matter in relation to being more practical! It's something I want myself... that I listen to the Koran now and then is a big step I've taken... and I'm happy about it... but I want to take the other steps.»

«Love that you religiously share pictures etc with me.. but feel every time you do it, it's on purpose. I feel like I have to answer for myself every single time. You are the one who motivates me daily. But what motivates me is when you do it for yourself without making me answer for me..»

What do you think that i should do with this? I am 100% willing to stop everything with him and not marry him for the sake of Allah. And for me to har peace in my heart."
791,"Hi, I’m not Muslim, but I am a member of the LGBTQIA+ community. I want to read the Quran because I want to learn more, but I understand that one must be clean in order to do so.

Where could I obtain an English version of the Quran?

I know I have so many questions, but I feel something drawing me to Islam even though I do not think I would make a good Muslim, mainly because I do so many haram things. Also, I live in an area where there are only a handful of known Muslims, so it would be difficult for me to find a Muslim community to connect with.

792,"How many of us are ready to follow what Allah says to the fullest extent? What if he told us to kill ourselves? (He obviously did not, this is an if condition Allah is telling us about)

We might not understand why Allah would tell us to avoid certain things or do certain things.. but we must believe that it is better for us,
Translation:
And if We had decreed upon them, ""Kill yourselves"" or ""Leave your homes,"" they would not have done it, except for a few of them. But if they had done what they were instructed, it would have been better for them and a firmer position [for them in faith].
And then We would have given them from Us a great reward. 
And We would have guided them to a straight path.

Throughout this time whenever we could see each other we would commit Zina (Astaghfirallah) even after I converted.

Right now, I feel as if I dont truly have a close, sincere friendships with anyone, most of the time I bear with it but sometimes it gets a but lonely. I do not fit the common interpretation of a 16 year old, I dont listen to music, I dont post on instagram, I dont use other social media platforms and sometimes it just feels like im alone. Even in school, I spend most of tlme walking alone, and even when im surrounded by many of my 'friends', i still feel alone. Im more serious than my peers, and just in general feel out of place. Alhamdullillah im blessed with a roof over my head, and good education, I do not forget my blesssing but sometimes it just get lonely."
795,"Salam all,

Ive been in distress for a long time about this situation. Basically I was in a relationship and I entered this relationship without knowing about what the deen has to say about relationships. I was always told that it was haram but i didn't know that nothing good comes out of it and there will be no barakah, i was young and i just didn't conceptualize how serious a haram relationship is. 

Once i learned this and as i got older, i decided that I do care about this person and i want a future and a marrige with them filled with barakah and for Allah to be happy with it,and that I dont want haram with them. We were also getting older (mid to late 20s) and it just seemed silly and pathetic to be in a relationship.

I made the effort to learn more about relationships and marriage. I distanced myself and set boundaries and wanted to focus on myself. Alhamduallh due to this it has made me much closer to my deen and open the door for my curiosity and passion to learn more about my deen. 

Long story short, i found out that he was cheating on me and was in a relationship with someone. He also betrayed me in many ways when i had found out. Due to the nature of the relationship, i know that he is in this relationship just for intimacy. (Tinder)

I feel heartbroken that he decided to pursue this relationship, but whenever i feel upset i feel like I am a hypocrite because we were in a haram relationship ourselves. Although the nature of both relationships are different i just feel like i am sinning everytime i get upset. 

I also feel like i have no right to be heartbroken or upset because its the result of haram. It is really hard to see the person you respected and cared for do haram. 

I just dont know how to manage and if this would be considered hypocrisy and how to just move on from the intrusive thoughts."
796,Why do I always s feel like Allah swt is angry at me I pray read Quran and do dikr but feel no connection I make dua in my sujood to feel a connection but I always get thoughts that god doesn’t want anything to do with me doesn’t love me or isn’t going to forgive me for my past sins or he doesn’t hear me I battle with these thoughts almost daily how do I change this
797,"Assalamu alaikum. I want and need to learn Arabic for secular motives as it will be a huge advantage on my job career. I'm a Muslim but I admit I'm not very practicing. I noticed that Fusha/classical Arabic programs that are religious based are usually very good. Tbh I'm not very interested in the Deen (astaghfirullah but that's the truth), my Imaan is very low but I hope that I can catch two bird with one stone if I join an Arabic program that will teach me both the language and religion/commitment to the deen. Is this a good idea? I recently came across an Arabic program by shaky Tim Humble which I respect very much and it's subscription based 14 euros a month for the basic program, has anyone tried this program or any other cheap religious based Arabic program? My iman is low as I said, my interest in religion is also very low and this makes me sad, I want to learn Arabic and about Islam but at the same time I find religion to be boring and this makes me feel very bad. Unfortunately I'm a stage of life where I know Islam is the truth but my motivation to become practicing is very low.

Do intelligent animals have a soul?(or some sort of free will?) Because certain animals display kind of ""human"" behaviour.

801,"I know I should ask an Imam or scholar but I’ve already messaged my uncle who is an Imam but he hasn’t gotten back to me yet since he’s on holiday. 

I sometimes forget what rak’ah I’m on when making salah. I’m working on my concentration and Khushoo’ but I usually make certain dua’s during my sujood to remember what rak’ah I’m on and I’m now wondering if this is bid’ah because I do it during every salah. 

For instance, if I’m praying Dhuhr or Asr, for the first rak’ah I’ll read a dua’ for my parents, second rak’ah I’ll make a dua asking for forgiveness, third rak’ah’ for something else and so on. Of course it’s after the compulsory saying so I’m not leaving off anything. The issue comes in when it’s the same dua’s I’m ‘recycling’. I know I can make sujood ul sahw but if I do that all the time it sort of feels like I’m ‘missing out’ or cutting out my salah if that makes sense.

Ali (presumably) was asked by a man why he chose to live near to a cemetery/graveyard and he responded that they are the best of companions as they are not excessive in speech, never lie, and they mind us of where we are all to go.
That's not exactly how it went but I'm hoping someone could recognize it from this.

As the title says 1st century Christians didn’t believe that the prophet and messenger the messiah Jesus son of Mary (as) did not die on the cross. In summary Ignacius, one of the early church fathers makes note of Jesus followers who were “zealous for the law” the law being the one found in the Old Testament. The video discusses more detail as to what he says and  about James (brother of Jesus I don’t know if they were biologically related or if it was an example of the brotherhood in the religion) kept and practiced the law.

Have you ever stopped to wonder about Al-Khidr, peace be upon him? Is he a prophet, a scholar, or something else?

&#x200B;

Have you ever been amazed by how Allah made him more knowledgeable, wise, and merciful than a prophet?

&#x200B;

Have you ever wondered why there was such determination for Musa, peace be upon him, to reach the place where he would meet Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, as mentioned in the verse: 

&#x200B;

\- “And \[mention\] when Moses said to his servant, 'I will not cease \[traveling\] until I reach the junction of the two seas or continue for a long period.” (Ayah 60 Surat AL-kAHF).

&#x200B;

Certainly, this story is unlike any other. The story of Musa and the righteous servant is different because it deals with knowledge that is not based on causality, and not the kind of knowledge the prophets received through revelation. 

&#x200B;

In this story, we encounter a mysterious type of knowledge, a knowledge of the highest decree, shrouded in thick veils, just like the place and time of their meeting. 

&#x200B;

This meeting is extraordinary because it answers the most challenging question that has haunted the human soul since the creation of Adam until Allah inherits the Earth and all that is upon it:

&#x200B;

Why did Allah create evil, poverty, suffering, wars, and diseases? Why do children die? How does destiny work?

&#x200B;

Scholars suggest that the righteous servant (Al-Khidr) was merely a personification of the speaking destiny.

&#x200B;

\- “And they found a servant from among Our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from Us a \[certain\] knowledge.” (Ayah 65 Surat Al-Kahf).

&#x200B;

One of the essential characteristics of the speaking destiny is that it is compassionate and knowledgeable, meaning mercy preceded knowledge. 

&#x200B;

So, the human messenger, Moses, asked,

&#x200B;

\- “May I follow you on \[the condition\] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement? (Khidr) said: Indeed, with me, you will never be able to have patience. And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge? (Moses) said: ""If Allah will, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught. He (Khidr) said: ""Then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till I myself mention it to you” (Ayah 66-70 Surat Al Kahf).

&#x200B;

Here begins the most critical journey to explain to us how destiny works.

&#x200B;

So, they embark on a journey, and Al-Khidr drills a hole in a boat, causing suffering for its owners. Imagine the terrible suffering the poor boat owners went through in the leaky boat? pain, fear, anxiety. 

&#x200B;

\- “So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, al-Khidhr tore it open. \[Moses\] said, ""Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing” (Ayah 71 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

It is human to question destiny, just as we do today.  


So, Al-Khidr replied:

&#x200B;

\- “Did I not tell you that with me, you would never be able to have patience? \[Moses\] said, ""Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty.'' (Ayah 72-73 Surat AL-Kahf).

&#x200B;

Then, after a commitment from Moses to be patient...

&#x200B;

The two men continue their journey, and the man whom God described as merciful before knowledge (Al-khidr) killed a boy. 

&#x200B;

They continue, and Moses, becomes increasingly angry. He reproaches the man with even stronger language: 

&#x200B;

\- ""So they set out, until when they met a boy, al-Khidhr killed him. \[Moses\] said, ""Have you killed a pure soul for other than \[having killed\] a soul? You have certainly done a deplorable thing."" (Ayah 74 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

This speech is coming from a prophet who receives divine revelations but is still a human like us, living the same bewilderment.

&#x200B;

The man, whom we know as Khidr, reiterates to Moses again: 

&#x200B;

\- ""Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"" (Ayah 75 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

They continue after Moses makes a final commitment to remain silent and not ask further questions.

&#x200B;

\- ""\[Moses\] said, If I should ask you about anything after this, then do not keep me as a companion. You have obtained from me an excuse. So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-Khidhr restored it. \[Moses\] said, ""If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment. \[Al-Khidhr\] said, ""This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience."" (Ayah 76-78 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

Here, some of the wisdom of the divine unfolds, some of which we may not fully comprehend until the Day of Judgment:

&#x200B;

There are three types of fate:

&#x200B;

1- 

&#x200B;

\- “As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every \[good\] ship by force” (Ayah 79 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

The first type is when you perceive something as evil, but God reveals that it was ultimately good. 

&#x200B;

What initially appeared as evil for the people in the boat turned out to be good for them. This is the first type, and we may encounter it in our daily lives.

&#x200B;

2-

&#x200B;

\- “And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief. So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy” (Ayah 80-81 Surat Al-Kahf)

&#x200B;

The second type is exemplified by the killing of the boy. You perceive it as evil, but in reality, it is good. However, God will not reveal this to you throughout your life, so you live thinking it's evil. 

&#x200B;

Did the boy's mother ever know the truth? Did Khidr tell her? No, her heart undoubtedly shattered, and she may spent many long nights grieving for her son, whom she had raised for years, only for a stranger to come and kill him. 

&#x200B;

She will never understand the reality of what happened until the Day of Judgment. Here, we face an inscrutable evil that occurred to the mother, and she will never comprehend it.

&#x200B;

3-  


\- “And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous. So your Lord intended that they reach maturity and extract their treasure, as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience” (Ayah 82 Surat AL-Kahf)

&#x200B;

The third type of fate, which is the most important, is the evil that God averts from you without you knowing, the hidden goodness that God guides to you but you never see or know. 

&#x200B;

Did the orphans know that the wall would collapse? No. Did they know that God sent someone to build it for them? No. Did they witness God's hidden kindness? Definitely not.

&#x200B;

…………………………………………

&#x200B;

Now, let's go back to Khidr's words, the one who speaks on behalf of fate: ""Did I not tell you that with me you would never be able to have patience?"" 

&#x200B;

You, as a human, will not be able to comprehend God's decrees. The image is bigger than your mind.

&#x200B;

This is why patience is not merely a commendable trait; Patience is a miracle. it trims the wings of human arrogance that refuse to surrender to matters whose purposes they do not understand.. If you still don't believe, remember Prophet (Ayoub).

&#x200B;

810,"Hi all. Looking for some guidance on interfaith relationships. To my knowledge  a Muslim man is allowed to marry a non-muslim woman as long as she is from “people of the book”. But what do you do if his parents aren’t willing to accept her for one reason and that is because she is not Muslim (she is Jewish) otherwise they believe she is the one for their son? Both parties spoke about children and the future and how they plan on raising the children, what’s to be expected , what’s not, what the overall plan will be. But  How do you go about this with parents ? Are there ways to approach the situation other then speaking to them, respecting them, asking for their blessing?what if it still gets nowhere and the blessing isn’t given ? Would specifically appreciate if an imam can guide here as to what can be done to prevent any harm for any parties…"
811,"I have a question. I like the idea of having a stable and steady income every month that doesn't change for the rest of my life. similar to retirement.

812,"Salam Alaykoum,

I did the shahada back in 2011 and life went on until I met my wife (she’s not Muslim)  in 2014, I forgot about Islam and lived my life like a non-believer until now. We got married (non-religious wedding) in 2017, our life was great. I told her about my past and me going to the masjid a few times, telling her stories about how it was at the mosque casually but she was always kind of against everything about Islam even to this day.

I tried to show her Islam but there’s nothing to do, she’s against Islam in its entirety which makes me feel awkward and uneasy. A few things happened in my life to which I asked Allah to help me and somehow I met someone who is open to Islam, I really don’t know what to do. I feel like my iman is coming back, I gave up on many things that are haram and try to do the salat without my wife knowing it for now."

I have been texting and seeing some girls around but most of their goals are different from mine and we lack common interest.  I saw this coming as there are just too most people aren't for us but I am losing patience and can't really hold my urges much longer.

822,"I study in high school atm and wake up around 6am to get ready and pray Fajr before 7. I go to school and school ends at 145, and we have mandatory sports at like 215, till after Asr.

I wanted some peoples opinions on whether I can pray Dhuhr earlier (arnd 7am) bcz the masjid is 5-10mins away from campus (speed walking as running is difficult bcz i have 2 bags on me), it takes me 12+ mins to pray Dhuhrain, and then 5-10 mins for back to campus, and changing and then going to sports like another 10mins. 


So it adds upto 30mins minimum, and then im late to sports, AND i also have academy at 4 so i wont be praying Dhuhrain anymore at school, Id go home and pray Asr, and Maghrib at the same time cz i hv consecutive classes till 630, and home by 710 when Isha at 730.


So, my question is, Can I pray Dhuhr at like 7am, Asr at 330pm when its time is 4pm, and (not sure about Maghrib, but also Maghrib at 4pm, bcz in winters if days get shorter then I wont be home before Isha).


Please read whole post before replying.

JazakAllah khair in advance.



EDIT: to all the people saying you cant pray before its time, you can if its a little early (i heard a lecture about it online) like Asr for me at 330, but its not that youre not allowed to pray early, you are but im asking about whether praying Dhuhr that early is permissable bcz i have to go to school. 


And no, i have 8 consecutive back to back classes from 8am to 145pm with a 20min break at 1045am, and youre not allowed to leave campus within break. 



NOTE TO EVERY PERSON: And you cant make wudhu on campus and theres no place to pray either. 



Its not a free campus, its just a building with several blocks and an open ground with a canteen. So i cant pray between 8 and 2 bcz im not free"
823,"Assalamu alaikum brbrothers and sisters, ill try to keep this short as possible.

 so my parents are basically against the hijab but theyre muslim... First time i started to wear it my parents where happy for me and i was happy. But all of a sudden they told me to stop being a ""extremist"" and they told me how i could get ""bullied"", how i would ""choke"" and etc etc. 

This broke my heart and i would sob whenever i would tell them i was gonna wear it when i go out with them but they told me not to.. So at this point... i dont go out anymore, i dont go nowhere... i only stay at home and that's it. 

And my heart even broke more when me, my brother, and my parents were watching a video about a niqabi girl and how she feels comfortable and better in the niqab. My family called her cooky, extremist, ghost, and mummy. And how ""If Allah made women beautiful then why should she cover her beauty"" yk all that stuff.. As they said all i legit felt my heart break into pieces and my jaw dropped. I ended up getting up from the living room and went in my room and cried and cried. 

How dare anyone say such a thing... :(

Ive did everything, they're making fun of me and calling me a extremist, making fun of other hijabis and such, heck i even quoted quran for them. I dunno what to do...

And i feel bad for my mom because she doesn't wear hijab, wears tight clothes, makeup, and has her pictures on social media (for work)... i don't want her to receive sins, for others to receive sins, and most importantly i don't want her to go to jannaham.

824,"i am a 16 year old man who recently started a clothing brand. when i first started contacting manufacturers, i obviously knew that i myself wouldn’t have enough to go through with this project.

so my mom decided to help invest with me and paid almost half of the fee (it was a pretty big fee)

since then i told her i would give her back her money.
then obviously a lot of problems started coming through, such as lowering the price A LOT for people who really wanted it but couldn’t pay the full price and many more.

i made many stupid decisions with this clothing brand and i’ve already announced that im  closing it today (not going to continue due to lack of time and effort as well as school)

826,"I'm extremely upset, angry and disappointed with what's going on in my life and I don't know how to handle these emotions while having patiences and faith in Allah. 

I truly have tried my best this year to be a better Muslim. Since ramadan (which has been my best ramadan yet) , I have consistently tried my best to pray Tahajjud every night. I've made it a habit to read Quran after Fajr. I also thank Allah for everything he has given me and have asked forgiveness from anything I did/may have done to anger the almighty . Alhumdulillah I had an opportunity to go for ummrah this year and made lots of dua there as well.

But my life seems to derailing. All my duas are either getting rejected or are not answered at all. My dad went from being promoted (he waited  5 years for this promotion ) to losing his job in a span of 1 month. I on the other hand (for 3 years),haven't had the opportunity to go to university straight after secondary school due to financial and visa reasons. However this year is when I can finally apply but have unfortunately 'failed' my medicine entrance exam for the 3rd time.  Further more, my mother is constantly suffering from chronic health issues and I have developed depression and anxiety in the past 4 years.  Because I haven't had a chance to go to university, I haven't been able to socialise/meet new people which has further degraded my mental health. All my friends have moved on in their life and will be graduating this year but I still haven't even started. 

I have poured my heart and soul into making dua everyday for Allah's help and mercy. But I don't understand why things are getting worse. After my exam yesterday I truly just gave up on making dua. I had no heart in my prayers and was just doing them because they are obligatory (yes I know its awful) and for the first time in a while I didn't wake up for Tahajjud or prayed Fajr on time. 

How do I handle all these negative emotions while maintaining my faith ? How do I convince myself to be content with Allah's plans when I see others thriving while I'm just derailing.

This whole not being guaranteed to wake up tomorrow has gotten me nervous a bit. Anyways, I have this one Christian friend that I'm close with n I wanted them to convert. I've always made dua for them to be guided and accept his guidance. I even woke up for tahajjud making dua. They told me they have never doubted Christianity n questioned it. So after they said that I was pretty much confused on how to make then interested in islam. He has also been practicing Christianity his whole life and that's the same religion his whole family practices. I doubt that even if I showed them tiktoks abt islam being the truth n stuff it still wouldn't convince him. Should I leave this to Allah S.W.t and let him deal with it? I already tried n failed n the only person who can create such miracles is Allah S.W.T"

834,"As-salamu alaykum.

I recently had a thought-provoking discussion with a friend. We delved into the concept of forgiveness in Islam, and I emphasized that God is the embodiment of mercy and forgiveness. The conversation took an interesting turn when my friend asked about a hypothetical scenario: If Dan Bilzerian or someone with a lifestyle like him genuinely converted to Islam after a profound epiphany later in life, would he be eligible for divine mercy and thus, entry to paradise and a chance to drink from the pool of Kawthar? Considering the deeds and reputation associated with Bilzerian, which could be regarded as severe transgressions in Islam, I was at a loss for words.

However, the Quran offers clarity with verses like: 'Surely, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed He is the most Forgiving, the Merciful' (Quran 39:53).

It's not our place to question the infinite wisdom and justice of Allah. Yet, the idea that such an individual might potentially ""get away with it"" can be unsettling for some. While a segment of Muslims might disapprove of Bilzerian's actions, there's no denying that there's another segment, not to mention non-Muslims, who admire or at least follow him on social media.

I'm genuinely curious about others' perspectives on this matter. Even if it feels like a peculiar scenario, in essence, it's not. I believe that if anyone seeks sincere forgiveness or converts to Islam, the sins from their previous life are eradicated. Some might view this as unjust, but that's the essence of our faith, and we accept it wholeheartedly. What are your thoughts on this?

JazakAllahu Khair"

Mostly because there’s certain things that i deep down just cant agree with. no matter how much research I do, how much I read, how much I think about it. I just don’t agree with them.

I myself am from a Muslim-majority country, yet most of my childhood is spent within a community of middle-class, ""career-first"" *diluted* Muslims.

It was first on my health then it came on my imaan on Allah and lately it came as if you love Allah you need to prove this to Him. Suddenly i remembered a thought of a hadith i read in the past where the prophet saw said that eating 7 ajwa dates in the morning, no poison will affect that person that day. Now the thoughts are coming that i should try this, and prove my imaan to Allah. And when i am not agreeing of doing it, its making me feel guilty that my imaan is weak, i will be punished by Allah.

I start to listen to music more often and become more vulnerable to p\*rn (I know that we shouldn't disclose our sins, but for better understanding). I tried to find the cause but nothing seems to be the cause. 

I am a college student and raise by parents such that I don't meet people other than college mates. I don't talk to girls in our college except for actual purposes (studies). I don't even talk to my male friends that much; just listening to their conversations but not being a part. I don't use swear words or do other sins (except the one I just told) like those openly done in the west (I am from Pakistan, so can't do those anyways).

Even with this, I always find myself in such situation where prayers become the hardest thing to be done, and music and bad online videos draw closer than I want them to be. Plus, it takes some serious depression (just before suicidal thoughts) that I consider turning back to Allah. 

Am I a hypocrite for this? I don't think that people get into this much as I am. How can I correct myself? I have been living like this for like 3 years.

He humiliates us, ridicules us etc. He doesn't smoke or do drugs or anything, he prays he fasts and is respected by everyone but most days he makes me and my mother cry either by his words or actions. My mother is a very religious woman and despite all our efforts to get her to leave him she wouldn't listen and says she will stay as our community isn't too kind to divorced women. I have been trying to get him to allow me to work for a while now because I want to get a car and take my mother to the hospital when she needs it and to drive her to work etc, because he refuses to, so I've been trying to get him to let me work for a while but he kept saying no. My mother urges me to keep asking him and so I have and I swear I speak with the utmost kindness and respect to him and I never talk back...

He finally agreed but said that he swears in front of God that he no longer wants to be my care-taker or take responsibility for me and that ""you and your mother can go take care of yourselves and decide amongst yourselves I no longer want anything to do with you."" He said he's sick and tired of the responsability and is handing it over to us and he even blocked me everywhere on my phone and said if I am ever in trouble and I call him he will beat me to death. 

I want to know, is it now permissible for me to work? I am also very ill and have been fighting a disease for 3 years now and he wasn't taking me to see a doctor. Is it permissible for me to go without asking him? Is it okay for me to work and collect enough money to help my mom and take her to the hospital and all that...

I know that the correct answer might morally be ""yes"" and I know it's the right thing to do for us both but I just want to know Islam's stance on this because my father told me ""you must not disobey your parents even if they ask to slit your throat."" And his lasts words to me during his speech were ""god said you should not discuss things with your parents even if they are doing something haram, you shouldn't tell them it is."" 

I'm really just afraid of angering god and I'm alone and lost and don't know what to do."
865,"Balancing Religion & Work?

Every year after Muharram or Ramadan I become very focused on going above and beyond with my deeds - praying nafl, reading 500-1000 ayat of Quran, praying extra salaat, reading duas for 1-2 hours, watching lectures, etc. This is easily 3-4 hours of worship per day. Then, life comes back around. 

Lately I’ve been just maintaining myself at work - not going above and beyond and my boss has caught on because I’m not working as much I used to. I work as a data scientist so it’s never ending learning, work, analysis, and picking up new skills. To be an average data scientist, you need to put in 10+ hours daily. 

My manager implied I’m not as productive as I was, and even took me off as a lead on a very interesting project. So now I’m confused, obviously Allah SWT wants us to pray as much as we can, but he also wants us to be hard working and successful in this world. Am I sacrificing a higher place in jannat if I’m using this time to work more (bc of this demanding job (which I enjoy btw)) 

I’ve heard that when we study and work (with the intention of pleasing Allah SWT and taking care of our family) it counts as ibadat. But is that more or less sawab than reciting the Quran? After all, all the Prophets and Imams had jobs right? I’m sure they didn’t have to work 60-80 hours like we do now, but still. 

How do you guys manage? Are there Hadith or scholarly comments on this? Any videos on YouTube?"

Imagine something good about the relation between humans and Allah and his Prophet (s.a.w.), but it was written with the opposite meaning, it‘s very terrible, estaghfirullah. Further it wished a blessed kandil (birthday of prophet, s.a.w.)
Could this be an organisation doing this on our doors here, could it be someone trying to harm only me and my family? How bad is it that I read it? I threw it away right after reading, but I did not even realize it, it was awkward though. Then a few hours later I realized, and I made dua. My belief in Allah is endless.

Excerpt from Tariq Jameel’s speeches.

Allah is saying to Prophet (saw):

“…nor can you replace any of your present wives with another, even if her beauty may attract you (husnuhunna)…” (33:52)

Despite how beautiful another woman is, your wives are not to be replaced.

Word used here ‘husn’ meaning external beauty.

However when it comes to marrying, Allah mentions:

“…then marry other women of your choice (taba)…”

Word used here is ‘taba’ meaning someone suitable. There is emphasize here on character.

‘Taba’ related to word ‘tayba’ meaning good fragrance.

You cannot see fragrance. But you can smell and experience it. It gives you a good feeling.

A person’s good character is like fragrance. It gives you a good feeling.

By using this word ‘taba’, Allah is saying not to make priority external appearance but character."

882,"Asallam alaikom wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu,

I am not suicidal, alhamdolilah I am very blessed, i have my health, i have abundance of food and my own bedroom.I am  a revert of 7 years and I love the Deen. The deen is perfect and easy  and all of it makes sense. 

I find it easy not to free mix for the sake of Allah and I love my life now that I can read and recite Quran and my life improved so much when I stopped listening to music.

I live in hijab 24/7.

I have been begging Allah in Sujood for a halal income. I had to leave my job because it prevented me from praying within the window of time for each prayer and there was too much haram everywhere, i.e pork on kitchen counters and being cooked in the same room as me etc.  I looked after old ladies and did their personal cleaning and care and was not always able to have a break.  My colleagues were too unreasonable. I had to serve food which was not halal although I NEVER served pork or alcohol.

I felt that because I couldn't pray within the windows of time, that one girl was giving me evil eye and I kept making human erros, i felt SO FAR from Allah even though I was caring for the vulnerable. I left.

My immediate family who I live with are secular, They keep getting annoyed that I won't greet any of the male friends they have, i.e my sister's male friends have complained that they used to be able to talk to me and now I go to my room and I do not greet them. I only say ""Asallam alaikom"" to elders and my friend's husbands but that's it. I left all my male friends and I feel so much better.

I don't speak with my nephews father like before. He lives with us and i only speak what is necessary.

My family CLEARLY see the benefits of the deen. They see how polite I am to them,, how patient, how dutiful and kind I am and I don't speak back. 

I recite the Quran to my nephew and he falls asleep within minutes but it takes them 1-2 hours to get him to sleep and they put stupid childrens lullabies on (with soft music instrument) to try and make   
 him sleep,. All they have done is raised a child who depends on his whims and desires for happiness...

They bring pork in the house , they are angry at me for so many things like insisting I have to pray on time. They keep saying ""you can join prayers"" BUT IT'S NOT TRUE.

They support Islam but they don't understand why I won't interact with my male cousins.

All my male cousins live abroad and I have tried using social media to explain to the female cousins that I no longer free mix.

They keep saying "" I can't wait for you to meet my husband""

I will only say Asallam alaikom but thats' it.

&#x200B;

Now I have a cousin visiting us soon  from abroad and he's going to want to greet me with a kiss and a hug and I'm not going to do that and he will GO MAD. They keep saying the same rubbish to me ""How can you not greet so and so, he's like your uncle, brother etc etc...""

I KEEP EXPLAINING TO THEM THAT MENS ENERGY IS NOT THE SAME AS WOMENS ENERGY AND THAT EVERY INTERACTION IS AN EXCHANGE OF ENERGY AND ITS NOT RIGHT TO FREE MIX.

They keep getting mad that i don't go to weddings with free mixing and I don't go to meet my female cousins because they want me to sit and mix with their husbands and i don't wish to sit together with them.

Everything makes them mad. They keep bringing meat which is not halal... i can't just serve it or put it in the fridge without feelin bad.

&#x200B;

I feel fed up of people who are like that and I keep asking Allah to take me home. i don't want to be in Dunya anymore.

I went through the MOST HALAL portal with a Wali from a mosque to try and get married but the brothers they keep showing me are so undesirable to me and I feel DEVALUED  I'm not attracted to any of them at all.

I feel there's no way I can bring children into this mess. They will want to be free like my nephew and live a life of cinema and music and all the stuff my mum says i'll be depriving my child of. 

I have tried SO MUCH DUA .

But people have free will and I want Allah to take me home. I am starting to feel fed up of caring about how sad everyone will be... I just want to go home.

I'm fed up.

Is it permissible to ask Allah to take us home or not ?

885,"One of the most common errors I see non-Muslims asking is this question, in order to raise doubts about the Quran's authenticity. The verse reads:



65. Do you not see that Allāh has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships which run through the sea by His command? *And He restrains the sky from falling upon the earth, unless by His permission.* Indeed Allāh, to the people, is Kind and Merciful.



The obvious problem this may appear to raise is: Can the sky fall? Is the sky even a material object? Does this not reflect 7th century Arabian peninsula ignorance? 


This question always caused some doubt in my mind, because it really does seem so strange a thing to say. However, yesterday, I was reading about the causes for life on the planet, from which was the perfect, Goldilocks-like balance between gravity, air density, and pressure on the earth. We should expect that, like water, the atmosphere should behave as a fluid and sink to the ground due to the effect of gravity. The reason this does not happen is that pressure prevents all of the air in the atmosphere from sinking completely to the ground. Therefore, it is a perfect balance between a gravity strong enough such that it can hold a stable atmosphere around it (unlike the Moon's gravity), and a perfect density and pressure that prevents the air from sinking and gives us the best atmospheric pressure for life; not too high and not too low.


Thus, we observe that indeed there are some forces responsible for the ""sky"" (atmosphere) not falling to the ground. Obviously Arabs at the time didn't know what gravity, density, pressure, or even atmosphere is, so Allah explains to them His favour upon them in a way that they can understand.


I'm not saying this is a miracle; obviously it isn't. Anyone could have said that their deities prevent the sky from falling upon them, because a material layer of sky was a common belief back then. But it does make us wonder about all of the mercies, blessings, and favours that Allah has put for us on earth, to make life easier. It also shows the undeniable existence of a Perfect, Omnipotent, and Precise God that has created the earth in perfect balance for life.


Ar-Rahman: So which of the favours of your Lord do you both deny?"

I pray when I’m with my friends but I’m always just copying the movement of the  person in front of me with no idea what to say I just spend the entire prayer copying the movement of whoever is in front of me and reciting Al Fatiha over and over again until the end of prayer I know that this isn’t correct but I don’t know what else to do I’ve missed years of prayers because I don’t know how to pray properly because prayer is meant to be an act of worship so if I go and do it wrong maybe it will be written as a sin or I will be punished for it I really don’t know if you have any advice I’d really appreciate it.

How are you meant to perform istinja properly and remain clean. As far as I know, after using the toilet, you are meant to clean with tissue and then pour water and you’re done. I’m a guy btw. However, this doesn’t work because there is always urine trapped in the urethra and the tip which comes out and so I have tried to squeeze it to ensure all the urine comes out from the urethra and tip but this has its own problems such as repetitively doing it as a result of ocd and then sometimes semen comes out and other problems. Also, I always feel like I am impure due to urine dripping but I don’t know if it is real. As a result, I always have to wet my underwear afterwards to convince myself it’s the water I put there myself. Also, HOW DO YOU USE THE TOILET WITHOUT SHOWERING AFTERWARDS? I always shower afterwards because I feel the toilet is impure and if I simply use the toilet, impurity may get onto other parts of my body or my clothes and I will be impure.

Is the last sentence of this Hadith a figure of speech or will people literally go to hell just for dyeing their hair black? But also how would the holy prophet know who goes to heaven or not? Only Allah can make that final judgement. 

I have to assume it's a figure of speech since only Allah knows who goes to heaven and who doesn't. But keeping that in mind, there's countless Hadith where the holy prophet talks about how doing such and such good things will land you in paradise or vice versa for bad things and not getting paradise.

I’d rather avoid having unnecessary interaction with opposite gender for a long period of time just to get to the real reason I was talking to her in the first place.

If you used to celebrate Mawlid Al Nabi, please share what caused you to stop celebrating it.
I am concerned because my husband has started celebrating it, and I don't know why. When I asked him, he said it is a good thing to remember the Prophet out of love, even though the Sahabas did not celebrate it. When I mentioned the hadith that says there are only two Eids, he said that it is not an Eid and that he does not pray Salatul Eid. He said that it is just a gathering to talk about the Sirah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and to feed the poor. I think his friends are influencing him, and I am worried not only for him but also for our children not to be confused by our different beliefs. Please share your story about what made you stop celebrating Mawlid Al Nabi.

922,"what is your opinion on trading forex, mind you, scholars don’t get to have an opinion when they say the current economic model is sound and working. 

I’m looking for your personal perspective. 

Forex market is where currency exchange happens, now the thing with currency exchange and currency in general, is that it is heavily tied with interest rates. Interest rates usually means 5 year treasury rate and 30 year bond rate. In my opinion this is supposed to be haram because of the simple and sane FACT that the driving force behind the economy is INTEREST. 

All the cash you see, all the billionaires(elon musk, bezos) they aren’t actually billionaires, they are billions in debt basically, because they utilized credit to build their companies and their companies are already pledged to the major investment banks/A-grade banks that they deal with, so no payment means your company gets seized by the bank, simple. The reason why they call themselves billionaires is because of the fact they still have ‘right of use’ of the shares they pledged to the bank, quiet twisted. For those that understand economics, will see where the problem arises, this IS NOT capitalism.

With all thats going in the economy, interest is what destroyed the economy, just as the quran stated it would. Now the question is, is it permissible to partake in the economic activities that enable such economic failure."

929,"When I was 16 years old, I embarked myself on a dream to become a game developer to create story-focused games that could perhaps even be worthy of being called GOTY (Game of the Year). And of course, in modern gaming, music is one of the most important aspect of a game, which is haram. You see, giving up on music when it's just a hobby is one thing because there's more to life than just music but in my case, there isn't more to life than game development. If I decide today to drop out of university, I have nothing left anymore because even a simple job at a restaurant or store, I can't even. This career that I'm chasing has been my only path ever since middle-school because I've always been bad at everything else, I can't even pursue another study, because I don't have the qualifications. Also, thanks to Allah, I have been saved from many failures because He has made the path to my goal easier. Why would He do all that only so that I ruin everything in an instant?

(2)  All humans, Muslims and non-muslims, will be punished for their sins, but Muslims will eventually enter Heaven after their punishment, whereas, non-muslims will remain in Hell, correct?

(3)  What is defined as a Muslim as required to enter Heaven, is the what we normally consider the 5 Pillars?   what is required for Heaven?

(4)  Can someone compare this to Christianity or Judaism?   From my understanding, Jesus died for all of Christians (and Jews) sins, so all of them will automatically be forgiven for their sins and automatically enter heaven?  Is this true?  If it is true, why even bother to do any good?

939,"More specifically, why do Muslims often not put ""(ra)"" after the names of the Apostles, and is it true that many Muslims don't consider Paul to be an apostle, thus invalidating much of the New Testament(not that you don't have other reasons against it)?

From Wikipedia: The following is a list of all the Qur'anic references to the disciples of Jesus: 

>But when Jesus felt \[persistence  in\] disbelief from them, he said, ""Who are my supporters for \[the cause  of\] Allah?"" The disciples said, ""We are supporters for Allah. We have  believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims \[submitting to Him\].  (52) Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have followed  the messenger \[i.e., Jesus\], so register us among the witnesses \[to  truth\].""(53)  
— Qur'an 3:52-53[\[1\]](https://quran.com/3)  
>  
>And \[remember\] when I inspired to  the disciples, ""Believe in Me and in My messenger \[i.e., Jesus\]."" They  said, ""We have believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims \[in  submission to Allah\].""(111) \[And remember\] when the disciples said, ""O  Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table \[spread with  food\] from the heaven?"" \[Jesus\] said, ""Fear Allah, if you should be  believers.""(112) They said, ""We wish to eat from it and let our hearts  be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its  witnesses.""(113) Said Jesus, the son of Mary, ""O Allah, our Lord, send  down to us a table \[spread with food\] from the heaven to be for us a  festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And  provide for us, and You are the best of providers.""(114) Allah said,  ""Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards  from among you - then indeed will I punish him with a punishment by  which I have not punished anyone among the worlds.""(115)

>O you who have believed, be  supporters of Allah, as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the  disciples, ""Who are my supporters for Allah?"" The disciples said, ""We  are supporters of Allah."" And a faction of the Children of Israel  believed and a faction disbelieved. So We supported those who believed  against their enemy, and they became dominant. (14)

Not that this has anything to do with Paul specifically, but wouldn't this make it make sense to put ""(ra)"" after the names of the other Apostles?

940,"Please please please don't think of this as trolling and just answer it with some reasons.

I can't talk to my therapist (he is non muslim) because of the very nature of this. I can provide more details on my reasoning and other details if necessary. 

You will help out a brother in desperate need. Jazak allah.

Edit: 
backstory, ever since i was young i have had dreams that come true and our prophet (pbuh) said that some of us will have this gift since iman is 1/43rd (?) Part of prophethood.

Now normally these dreams are not very common. But since last 10 years i have dreamt about a woman who i called my wife, i knew her name, family and other stuff. Never thought she was real because i didn't know that those dreams were true dreams. But I met someone last year, and after knowing her family i instantly remembered all those dreams about her.

She says she believes in allah, but she is not that religious. Since she grew up in germany, she doesn't dress like a muslim, she drinks etc. 

We do have a good time together like we cant stop talking to each other etc. But here's the issue: she lies to me a lot, whether its about her drinking who she is with etc. etc.

Even though, we weren't just friends as in we didn't do anything inappropriate but we both had feelings for each other and i have been honest about my intentions and the dreams and she said she believed them as well. But after she moved to a different city, she hasn't been faithful to me, like suddenly i was just a friend, and later i found that she had been on dates with other people.


To be completely honest, i did not mind her non-religiousness at the start (cuz allah can change her mind) but after all that has happened, it makes me very very uncomfortable.

But the issue is that every action that i take that will make me escape her, i get a dream that shows she is still in my future and then parts of that dream comes true.

I also was not religious because I said to myself that I didn't have enough proof of allah and so the only prayer i did to allah for about a year was ""show me something that you are real, show me something that can not be explained with science"" and these dreams got more intense afterwards so to fulfill my promise i became religious.

I guess i am also putting her on the same standard. When she says she believes in allah and when i have given her enough proof by telling her soo many dreams that came true already, she should act like she believes in allah.

I am so lost because I really can't take to anyone without them thinking I am crazy.

This thought makes me crazy that if she did believed allah like me, after those dreams kept coming true she should have acted like a muslim. How can i be with her when she isn't faithful to her own beliefs? How can she say she is a muslim? Why does allah tell me she is the best fit for me (did a lot of istikhara)?
How can i be with someone who has hurt me so much?"
941,"Salam, 

I have had problems with mental health for a long time. I take medication and I go to therapy. I have very severe OCD. I’ve made dua for Allah to heal my OCD and it He has not. I went to a shrine and prayed for healing from my OCD but now it is worse. 

I think I have some of the symptoms of being possessed by a jinn. I can’t pray at all not because I’m lazy but because I find it emotionally distressing to the point I bite myself and breathe heavily and then have to be alone to calm down or take a pill. I feel so distressed in sujud I will claw at the carpet with my nails. I feel averse to listening to azan or reading the Qur’an or hearing it. I can’t bring myself to pray because I feel so anxious and upset about it - before, during, and after. 

I have really terrible nightmares and I can’t sleep at all. I feel constantly angry, anxious and have crying spells. When I fall asleep my limbs jerk and twitch. I get constant feelings I am in another dimension."

946,"Asalam u alaikum,

So I had my nikkah with my wife a few months back. It was an arrange marriage. I live overseas in the UK, around 8-9 hours from flight from her. We were meant to have our wedding in a few months time. 
But due to my parents personal beliefs and plans, they want to postpone the wedding a year from now.  A cultural ritual called ‘rukhsati’ is needed in our Pakistani culture before the couple can live together which is after the wedding. Me even taking her out as her lawful husband is seemed as taboo as the ‘rukhsati’ isn’t completed. 
I had a mini argument with my parents regarding this and I had to stop myself as they started getting emotional and telling me how Allah will punish me and be unhappy that I’m arguing with them. 
I’m 22 and had my nikkah done to avoid zina as it’s very prevalent in my country. The temptation is even harder as I go to university. Brothers can relate. 
My wife is upset as she wanted to live with me and spend time. 

What can I do in this situation? 
JazakAllah Khair"
948,"Hey, fellow Redditors,

I've been wrestling with some thoughts lately, and I wanted to open up a discussion on a topic that's been on my mind. I know that many people believe that God, or in my case, Allah, has the power to make the impossible possible. It's a beautiful and comforting belief that has inspired hope and miracles in the lives of countless individuals.

However, sometimes I find myself questioning whether I'm truly worthy and deserving of such divine intervention. Or worse, I wonder if I'm not important enough for Allah to perform something amazing for me. Has anyone else ever felt this way?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on this matter. How do you reconcile these doubts with your faith? Have you witnessed or experienced moments when you thought you weren't worthy, but something incredible still happened? Let's have an open and supportive conversation about this aspect of faith and belief."

951,"Hellooo! I’ve been reading about Islam and have been listening to and reading the Quran for almost the last year. I have some anger and anxiety issues and since dropping out of college it’s been worse, but learning about Islam and listening to the Quran brings me a type of peace I can’t explain. I’ve never been religious and was actually strongly agnostic for a while. I’ve been saying I want to learn more about Islam before I take my shahada but I don’t think that’s the real reason I haven’t taken it. Im not sure if it’s my family’s or partner’s ( all Christian) reaction I’m scared of but I’m not sure.
I’ve been to my local mosque and the whole drive there I was vibrating with anxiety, but the second I stepped foot in the building I instantly was at peace. I’m currently going through a lot financially, emotionally, mentally and spiritually and I came across a revert story that sounded so similar to mine that idk it might be the sign. I’m quite nervous and plan to set a meeting with my local mosque lady(idk what her title is I’m so sorry) and see what happens. 
I’m tired of feeling like I’m living without a purpose and doing nothing with my life. I want friends I can relate too, learn and grow with. I want to be successful and go back to school. I’m really just ranting but this is the first time I’ve ever put these thoughts in text lol

954,"Hey there, I want to share what's been going on with my 25-year-old big brother because it's been a rollercoaster for the last 10 years, and it's been tough on our family. I'm 22F, by the way.

It all started when I was in 10th grade. My brother began acting out, doing things like skipping school, coming home super late, and getting into arguments with our mom. This went on for two years, and then things went from bad to worse in my senior year of high school.

Senior year was supposed to be all about focusing on my studies to get into college, but every day I'd come home to a house filled with drama, all thanks to my brother. At that time, my dad was visiting, and my brother got involved with an older Christian girl, which seemed to set him off. He'd come home wasted and get into fights with people. No matter how much we talked to him, gave advice, prayed for him, or even got a sheikh involved, nothing seemed to help.

Towards the end of that year, he left a note on his bed saying he was running away for his own good. That night, we found him before he could go and begged him to stay. But he yelled that he hated us and that his girlfriend was everything we weren't. He left that night and didn't come back for two years, and when he did, he was a completely different person.

He didn't come back because he really wanted to; he'd often say that if he had a regular job and some education, he'd never have returned. But when he did, things went from bad to worse. He'd yell at us, get into fights with our neighbors, and not show any respect to anyone, not even his buddies. Most of the time, he'd just sleep all day and night, and we'd only see him when he wanted food or money. Lately, we found out he's been using the money to buy alcohol and weed. 

What's even more frustrating is that he keeps making up stories about his future plans, saying he's going to school and will become successful, even though he didn't even finish high school. And just so you know, he's got some serious resentment for our parents because our dad was super strict about our education and studies when we were kids. It came from our dad's own tough childhood, growing up without a dad, and being the first in his family to break out of poverty and make something better of himself.

For the past eight years, from the time he was 17 to now at 25, I've watched my mom lose sleep, cry, and pray endlessly for him. It's heartbreaking, especially when we're going through financial struggles, and he still demands money and disrespects us.

I'm at a loss for what to do anymore, and it's frustrating. We don't know which verses to turn to or what to do to get Allah to help us through this. There are so many more stories about what he's done that I've left out because this post would be never-ending, but any advice or support would mean the world to us."

I feel like an idiot but just think about it the people that you've wronged in the past they'll have the same fate as you dead and below a stone live everybody else will be no matter the status race anything I don't know what to think anymore although paradise is great I love living I can't die but I don't want to accept there's nothing there I'm just crying knowing that the only way of life is to die, so what's the point of even doing things like having a job or playing games there's no POINT we're all going to die I don't want to live any more I can't live knowing that'll I will be remember as nothing even if my family legacy goes on I just don't want to think but it'll happen no matter what I say soon my family before me will die and I will be next I just don't want to live this way"

I was watching YouTube shorts the other day and I kept seeing Islam (I don’t know the word for people who teach Islam, and i apologize if I offend you by this, so I will just call them teachers) teachers teach on the street and debate islam and Christianity. One of the big points was, how could Jesus be God and man?  I will answer this question like this: let’s say you have a potion that turns you into a dog for long enough that you can do what you want to, but when you are done you turn back into human. At the end of the day you are still human, and a dog. That’s how Jesus works.  God sent his son, Jesus as a human to die for us. Now you may be wondering “how can jesus be God?” And for this question, answers may vary. I like to think of it as a different form of God. This may not be true but this is the way that makes the most sense to me. This is not supposed to be anything that offends or to push my religion onto people. This was just a way to get people to understand, and as a discussion point to Christianity. I hope you all well and a great day."

Whenever someone enters.. Be it me or her, if I forget saying the Salaam myself she would taunt me and say what I mentioned before. Shouldn't it be if one person forgets, then the other should say the Salam themselves and be the greater person instead of pointing it out?

Just for context, my mother is an extremely narcissistic woman and also emotionally abusive, and she is NOT that religious.. It almost feels like it is a matter of ego for her to say the salaam first, and it would be disrespectful for her to say the Salaam first. Mind you, she never says the Salaam first. NEVER. 
Is she actually right that the younger always have to say the Salam first, or is it only her ego that's stopping her? How do I talk to her about it since she never seems to listen or acknowledge anything anyone else says"
969,"I'm aware that regarding the wife, there's a ruling that says that she won't go to heaven if her husband is not satisfied of her and doesn't obey her husband. But is there any similar ruling for the husband if the wife is not satisfied of her husband? 

To put things into perspective, imagine there's a household where the husband doesn't fulfill his role as a provider, ignores his responsibilities and allows his wife to single-handedly support an entire house financially. This wife struggles everywhere, to pay electricity, food, water, rent because she has a low income. The husband is fully aware of the situation and can help but acts as if he can't. This situation causes grave sorrow to the wife where she is in despair because no one helps her. 
It is important to know that the wife and husband are not divorced but live in 2 different countries because of work. 

What will Allah do with such husband. What's the ruling?"
970,"Did you ever make a dua, then thought that Allah responded with a ‘no’ but it turned out, some time later, to be just a delay in His answer and He was simply testing your patience?

I want to be more inspired and motivated to continue this dua of mine. Please help me by sharing your success stories."
971,"Welcome to our Hinduism sub! Sanātana Dharma (Devanagari: सनातन धर्म meaning ""eternal dharma"") is the original name of Hinduism. It is considered to be the oldest living religion in the world.  Hinduism is often called a ""way of life"", and anyone sincerely following that way of life can consider themselves to be a Hindu.

If you are new to Hinduism or to this sub, review this material before making any new posts!

We also recommend reading [What Is Hinduism](https://www.himalayanacademy.com/view/what-is-hinduism) (a free introductory text by Himalayan Academy) if you would like to know more about Hinduism and don't know where to start.

If you are asking a specific scriptural question, please include a source link and verse number, so responses can be more helpful.

In terms of introductory Hindu Scriptures, we recommend first starting with the Itihasas ([The Ramayana](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRamayana/wiki/resources#wiki_recommended_texts), and [The Mahabharata](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMahabharata/wiki/resources#wiki_resources).) Contained within The Mahabharata is [The Bhagavad Gita](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGita/wiki/resources), which is another good text to start with. Although r/TheVedasAndUpanishads might seem alluring to start with, this is NOT recommended, as the knowledge of the Vedas & Upanishads can be quite subtle, and ideally should be approached under the guidance of a Guru or someone who can guide you around the correct interpretation. 

In terms of [spiritual practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/7643rp/a_thread_on_introductory_rescources_on_basis_of/), there are many you can try and see what works for you such as r/Introspection, r/yoga, r/meditation or r/bhajan. In addition, it is strongly recommended you visit your [local temple/ashram/spiritual organization](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/c6957l/what_are_some_good_hindu_organizations_that_have/).

Lastly, while you are browsing this sub, keep in mind that Hinduism is practiced by over a billion people in as many different ways, so any [single view](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/p7ma64/sectarian_bias/) cannot be taken as representative of the entire religion. 

###Here is a section from our FAQ that deserves to be repeated here:

Disclaimer: Sanatana Dharma is a massive, massive religion in terms of scope/philosophies/texts, so this FAQ will only be an overview. If you have any concerns about the below content, please send us a modmail.

###**What are the core beliefs of all Hindus?**

* You are not your body or mind, but the indweller witness Atma.
* The Atma is divine.
* Law of Karma (natural law of action and effect)
* Reincarnation - repeated birth/death cycles of the physical body
* Escaping the cycle of reincarnation is the highest goal (moksha)

###**Why are there so many different schools/philosophies/views?  Why isn't there a single accepted view or authority?**

Hinduism is a religion that is inclusive of **everyone**.  The ultimate goal for all Sanatani people is *moksha*, but there is incredible diversity in the ways to attain it.  See this post : [Vastness and Inclusiveness of being Hindu](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/ese8rc/vastness_and_inclusiveness_of_being_hindu/).  Hinduism is like a tree springing from the core beliefs above and splitting up into innumerable traditions/schools/practices.  It is natural that there are different ways to practice just like there are many leaves on the same tree.

###**Do I have to blindly accept the teachings?  Or can I question them?**
Sanatanis are not *believers*, but *seekers*.  We seek Truth, and part of that process is to question and clarify to remove any misunderstandings.  The Bhagavad Gita is a *dialog* between a teacher and student; the student Arjuna questions the teacher Krishna.  In the end Krishna says ""I have taught you; now do what you wish"".  There is no compulsion or edict to believe anything.  Questioning is welcome and encouraged.

###**Debates and disagreements between schools**
Healthy debates between different sampradayas and darshanas are accepted and welcomed in Hinduism.  Every school typically has a documented justification of their view including refutations of common objections raised by other schools.  It is a shame when disagreements with a view turn into disrespect toward a school and/or its followers.

###**Unity in diversity**
This issue of disrespect between darshanas is serious enough to warrant a separate section.  Diversity of views is a great strength of Hinduism.  Sanatanis should not let this become a weakness!  We are all part of the same rich tradition.

Here is a great post by [-_Gandalf_-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-_Gandalf_-/) : [Unite! Forget all divisions](https://www.reddit.com/r/hinduism/comments/13pqnh4/unite_forget_all_divisions/).  It is worth repeating here.

Forget all divisions! Let us unite! Remember, while letting there be the diversity of choice in the Dharma: Advaita, Dvaita, Vishistadvaita, etc*, we should always refer to ourselves as ""Hindu"" or ""Sanatani"" and not just ""Advaiti"" or any other specific name. Because, we are all Hindus / Sanatanis. Only then can we unite.

Let not division of sects destroy and eliminate us and our culture. All these names are given to different interpretations of the same culture's teachings. Why fight? Why call each other frauds? Why call each other's philosophies fraud? Each must stay happy within their own interpretation, while maintaining harmony and unity with all the other Sanatanis, that is unity! That is peace! And that is how the Dharma shall strive and rise once again.

Let the Vaishnavas stop calling Mayavad fraud, let the Advaitis let go of ego, let the Dvaitis embrace all other philosophies, let the Vishistadvaitis teach tolerance to others, let the Shaivas stop intolerance, let there be unity!

Let all of them be interpretations of the same teachings, and having the similarity as their base, let all the schools of thought have unity!

A person will reach moksha one day, there is no other end. Then why fight? Debates are supposed to be healthy, why turn them into arguments? Why do some people disrespect Swami Vivekananda? Let him have lived his life as a non-vegetarian, the point is to absorb his teachings. The whole point is to absorb the good things from everything. So long as this disunity remains, Hinduism will keep moving towards extinction.

ISKCON is hated by so many people. Why? Just because they have some abrahamic views added into their Hindu views. Do not hate. ISKCON works as a bridge between the west and the east. Prabhupada successfully preached Sanatan all over the world, and hence, respect him!

Respecting Prabhupada doesn't mean you have to disrespect Vivekananda and the opposite is also applicable.

Whenever you meet someone with a different interpretation, do not think he is something separate from you. Always refer to yourself and him as ""Hindu"", only then will unity remain.

Let there be unity and peace! Let Sanatan rise to her former glory!

Hare Krishna! Jay Harihara! Jay Sita! Jay Ram! Jay Mahakali! Jay Mahakal!

May you find what you seek."

975,"I am writing this because I came a cross a video by an Atheist channel that read the Gita and claims it to be be a violent scripture. The allegation is that Krishna tells Arjuna essentially that he has to kill his family because that it his duty as a warrior and it won't matter as they will reincarnate. The implication being that it doesn't matter who it is the killing is against, it is your duty. In one video he gives examples of Nazi soldiers on trial saying that they were following orders as an example. 

I was wondering if that perosn knows that the Kauravas were bad people deserving to be killed. Granted even if that was the case, the problem is Krishna never said that Arjuna must kill the Kauravas because they are bad people and justice must be given, rather Krishna says that he is a warrior who has to fight.

Why are there so many individuals in this sub who rely solely on colonial-era translations of the Vedas and then assume they're more knowledgeable than every single Acharya this land has known? Time and time again, I've seen countless people reference a so-called ""Vedic era"" or ""Puranic era."" Don't these imbeciles realize that Maharishi Veda Vyasa, the very person who divided the Veda into the four Vedas, also authored the 18 Puranas? Why on earth do these individuals solely rely on and accept translations of the Vedas made by colonial officials? Is Maharishi Veda Vyasa somehow inferior to Max Muller and others?

979,"I have found my home worshipping Lord Shiva and in advaita vedanta. I'm looking into Kashmir Shaivism as well. I have such love and faith in Shiva. 

I was raised Christian but couldn't connect with God. I felt empty and prayed and prayed feeling forsaken. I later searched for other spirituality finding more connection in paganism, buddhism, and finally my home hinduism. I felt connection with Dionysus and Guan Yin but not the Christian God. 

With Shiva being the One with many faces I question why I couldn't connect with the divine before? Ultimately it led me to where I am now but I still struggle with seeing myself as inherently sinful and flinch when someone tells me God loves me. I'm trying to see God just as Shiva (or Ma Durga or Ganesha) but I still have old wounds. 

Is there any advice to heal and reason I could see the Divine in other religions (pagan and buddhist) but not Christianity?"

This year, over the last few weeks I’ve been seeing his picture and name everywhere around me and I just woke up just now from a dream (Bramha Murhurtam), just like yesterday where a small boy is calling me to come see him. 

I had asked my grandpa and he said some people start with Dasara for a 4 month Deeksha. I don’t live in the same house or anywhere near him and he can’t really make the journey anymore. Does anyone here have any experience with the Deeksha? Can I contact any Shashta temple and get details?

Are there any devotees of Sai Baba of Shirdi that have prayed to him and received a blessing or miracle?

I am in serious need of a blessing and Sai Baba started showing up on my Instagram.  I really don’t know that much about him, but I do feel drawn to him.

It’s my (limited) understanding that he always told his followers that he is there for them and will help them, whether in a body or not.

If you’ve received a blessing or miracle from him, what did you do?   Did you just pray to him?  Repeat a mantra (I only know “Om Sai Ram.”)?

997," If we have to be free from karma, the Vedas and the Upanishads subscribe to the four Mahavakyas. The four Mahavakyas are the essence of the entire scriptures Tat Twam Asi, Ayam Atman Brahma, Aham Brahmasmi, Prajnanam Brahma. These 10 words along with two root words Neti Neti, summarize in 12 words what the Vedas and Upanishads want to communicate to us. If we are able to realize Neti Neti; we are not the body that does karma, not the mind and ego that drives karma; if we realize Tat Twam Asi, we are that; Ayam Atman Brahma, this Atman is Paramatma, then we become a Divine instrument. We become free from all karma, we become free from the cycle of death and rebirth. It is just 12 words from the Vedas and Upanishads that can give us Moksha. "

If you have been studying Sanatana dharma for a while now, surely u must have heard of lokas

The reason for this post is because people confuse lokas (realms) for grahas(celestial bodies)

Let me explain:

According to scriptures there are 14 lokas/physical realms in each universe. Point to be noted these realms are physical...which means they can be experiences through different senses....yes human bodies might be too weak to handle the physical power of these realms but they can be experienced through a different meterial body which is suitable/ semi divine.

these 14 lokas are namely:

 

1. [Satya-loka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmaloka) (Brahma-loka)
2. Tapa-loka
3. Jana-loka
4. Mahar-loka
5. [Svar-loka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svarga) (Svarga-loka)
6. Bhuvar-loka
7. Bhu-loka
8. Atala-loka
9. Vitala-loka
10. Sutala-loka
11. Talatala-loka
12. Mahatala-loka
13. Rasatala-loka
14. [Patala-loka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patala)

Right now we are in bhuloka which is in the centre of all these realms. And in bhuloka we live in a celestial body known as ""Bhugol"" which literally translates to 'that which is round' and no bhugol does not come under 'nava grahas'/ the nine celestial bodies.

**AS PER MY KNOWLEDGE THESE REALMS COULD EVEN BE GALLAXIES BUT AGAIN I CANNOT BE SURE.**

1008,"While ago I heard a story about shiv, 

The story goes like this:

There was a king who loved art and poetry, once he gathered brilliant poets and artists and told them to create a painting and one poem on that, after some time he sow the painting and heard the poems of each, the last poet made painting depicting Shiva fearfully running away and maa Parvati laughing and then poet describes the whole incident.

1024,"As someone who's not very versed in Hindu culture, I wonder how Hindus in the past and present visualize figures with multiple faces (like Ravana for example). When I listened to the Ramayana, I found it very hard to conjure up a realistic image of Ravana when he was fighting Rama. I know entities with multiple faces are often portrayed as having a kind of horizontal bar or row of heads all seemingly attached to one another, but for some reason, I can't create a picture in my head of how such a construction of body parts would look in a somewhat realistic scenario. I wonder how Hindus now (and perhaps in the past) 'saw' these beings in their mind?"
1025,"Hello everyone! I’m a philosophy student at the University at Albany and I’m doing research about the viewpoints of different religions and practices. I decided that I would love to reach out to people with different perspectives! In particular, about Aristotelean virtues. I believe that hearing from people themselves is much more valuable than just looking it up online. 

Anyway, if you’d like, would you want to answer some questions about your practices’ views on virtues? You can answer as many or as few as you’d like. I’m not weighing the results against each other, just seeing the similarities and differences with Aristotle! I am also aware that each religion and practice has so much diversity, so if you’d like you could just tell me about your own if applicable!

Aristotle’s virtues are wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. Aristotle says that these virtues come from within and are honed throughout our lifetime. 

So, these are the questions I've come up with:

1. Out of the virtues I mentioned above, which three are the most important, or the most emphasized in your practice, and why? If there’s others that are important, please feel free to mention them!

2. In your practice, where do virtues come from? Aristotle says that they are honed within us over our lifetimes- how about yours? Do they come from a higher power, from the universe, from yourself, etc? 

3. For Aristotle, “eudaimonia” is the highest possible good a person can be, without using it as a means to an end. Eudaimonia is achieved by living virtuously, or living with moral excellence. What does your practice say about how we can achieve this peak good?

4. What does acting virtuous look like in the daily life of someone who is involved in your practice?

Thank you so much! Your feedback is very appreciated."

1027,"I first want to say I respect Hindus and Hinduism. I think there can be bad people who hurt your good religion just as there can be with Christians, Muslims or any other.

I have heard of a man who is excusing the child sexual abuse of very young sons by saying it was common India and not taboo.  I frankly think this is not your religion or culture. But is there any rationale basis for this? If the child is a girl.. is child sexual abuse of girls… familial or not… common? Is abuse of child girls by a spiritual leader a crime in India? Boys?

Another question is, if a man thinks he is the a reincarnation of Krishna, the current avatar of his time, and has many followers who think he is their guru and is a Master and like Krishna. If the man is married and has sex with his followers who call themselves Gopis would there be a scriptural justification for this? Would it not just be an abuse of power?

I am not trying to insult your religion. I think this man is an insult to your religion using it to excuse his bad behavior. But I would like to know what actual Hindu ethics would say about these things?"

Where is God, who doesn't care about the suffering of these beings? Don't tell me it's past lives Karma and all, who has seen that honestly? It like saying believe me but I can't show you the proof.

I read somewhere that the concept of Kalki Avatar was added later in Hinduism. I have no idea how much true it is. 

The time when Kali Yuga will end seems way too long. Humans might become another species by then. Kali Yuga will have a few Hindus surviving. I do not think anyone from any present religions surviving then."
1037," Sanatana Dharma is highly respected and some consider it to be the greatest because it is an eternal way of life. It is not a religion that talks of a God that lives in the sky. Sanatana Dharma is a scientific method of evaluating the truth. It talks of Neti Neti, we're not this body, not this mind and ego. Tat Twam Asi, we are that — the Divine energy, the power, the Soul. Therefore, Sanatana Dharma is not just another religion with rituals and superstitions. Sanatana Dharma is a 5000 year old tradition, it is the carried down wisdom of the sages and it is from Sanatana Dharma that several other religions have sprouted. But none of the religions can match up to Sanatana Dharma, the eternal truth. "

I was wondering why Lord Brahma is no longer popularly worshipped in the way that Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu are ? I also wanted to know which of the three are considered the god of creation and destruction ? From what i have seen both Brahma and Vishnu are considered gods of creation and Shiva is considered the destroyer. Can anyone give me some clarity ?"

I have read Amar Chitra Katha in childhood and those are very good for children but the stories are quite straightforward and simple where as we know how philosophical our texts are in reality. I am finding a hint of such type of work from the above uploaded photo hence the wish to find it. 

If anyone know other such comics, which have kept the complexity and philosophy of the ancient texts somewhat intact, then please kindly suggest 🙏. 

There are a bunch of comics which focus on the relatively popular topics like Mahabharat, Ramayan, or Shiva Vibah in particular, Bal Krishna, and other such topics. I am trying to find something that might focus on the something more obscure and complex.

I had some flashbacks today which shook me and I find it difficult during these moments to believe in karm and dharm.

Thanks

Blessed are the brave warriors who fight a righteous war for the sake of the truth because the gate of Paradise opens for them.
Gita 2:32

Commentary:
Lord Krishna emphasized that fighting/dying for the truth will make us go to the heavenly worlds. It means that fighting for the truth is the most holy duty for us from the Most High. If you want to think about it, aren't we surrounded by different kinds of transgressions in this life, which come from all kinds of our own negative desires to the inhuman suppression and despair of human nature. A type of government, discrimination and other unjust things that seem to be endless and are always around us at all times. 

We can see this in our own history in Babaylan Tamblot's revolt. Didn't Tamblot fight for the protection of her kuladarma (clan and people's traditions that they hold dear) ? It was her duty to her faith and it is important to protect it from foreign invaders.

In the long run, although she was killed by the Spanish Christians, her memory is not a failure, but her resistance against the oppressors was one of the sparks that fueled the subsequent uprisings in this archipelago that resulted in the liberation of our nation. Individuals like Tamblot are also free, not on earth but in spirit. Blessed is she among the deities. As mentioned in the previous passages, one of the best karmas is to die for justice and truth regardless of the consequences."
1051,"Given the fact that Hinduism and it's scriptures/texts are so extensive, I wonder how much effort historically, and to this day, have been done to safeguard and digitize and collect/preserve it all? I imagine it is a huge task, but I can also understand the difficulties with for example retrieving any document/scriptural/cultural heritage that remains in Pakistani Hindu temples/regions? Just in case some shit happens.   


I mean the more versions you have of the same Hindu related text, the more accurate you can extract the original message from it and remove interpolations, so is there like some worldwide effort to get absolutely everything related to Hinduism digitized and safely collected and stored in like one digital place? Or multiple ones, if that helps. You know, before ancient texts and writings are gone forever, I think Hindu organizations should absolutely make this their #1 priority.

1068,"Verse translation: Greater is their trouble whose minds are set on the 'Unmanifest' ; for the goal, the 'Unmanifest', is very hard for the embodied to reach.  


Commentary of Verse 12.5 by Swami Chinmayananda:

After explaining how the goal reached by all meditators is one and the same Supreme Perfection, Lord Krishna tries to compare the two incomparable 'Paths', both of equal efficacy and merit. He says ""GREATER IS THE TOIL OF THOSE WHOSE THOUGHTS ARE FIXED ON THE UNMANIFEST."" This declaration, when read as such and in itself, is not only an advocacy of the 'Path-of-Devotion' to a PERSONAL GOD, but almost amounts to a positive condemnation of meditation upon the Formless. Such an erroneous and misleading interpretation will render the Geeta a scripture that contradicts the 'eternal wisdom' of the Upanishads. And yet, there are vocal champions of devotion (Bhakti), who quote this half stanza to beguile the faithful!

The first line is commented upon and elucidated by the following line in the stanza. Lord Krishna explains why it is hard ordinarily for seekers to contemplate upon the Formless. ""THE UNMANIFEST IS VERY HARD INDEED FOR THE EMBODIED TO REACH."" The crucial word in the stanza is 'embodied.' It is often very directly understood to mean ""all those who have a physical structure."" The absurdity of such an understanding would become evident if we follow the natural corollary of such an interpretation. If all those who are having a physical body can meditate only upon the form of the Lord, then it follows that pure meditation upon the Formless is to be undertaken only after the body is dropped and the seeker is dead.

Shri Shankaracharya, therefore, clearly explains that the ""EMBODIED"" means ""those who are attached to their bodies."" Sunk in flesh, if one personality lives only a life of sensuality and satisfaction of one's body-cravings, one will find it too difficult to take to steady and continuous meditation upon the subtle theme of the Infinite, Formless and All-pervading. An old man whose vision is lost and whose hands are shaky, may find it very difficult to thread a needle; so too, a mind and intellect agitated, panting and restless, suffering from desire-plays, are not vehicles that can successfully fly beyond the frontiers of names and forms to the endless Spiritual Glory.

In short, to the majority of us, meditation upon the Lord, as expressed in the Universe, is easier and more profitable. Man can worship the myriad forms through service undertaken in a spirit of worship and divine dedication. By doing so, the body-attachments and sense-appetites get purged from his inner make-up and his mind becomes subtle enough to conceive and contemplate upon the Formless and the Imperishable Unmanifest."
1069,"Kamadeva appeared in my life in such a random way.

 I'm from Brazil in South America, and here, Hinduism practices are not common. We have a lot of yoga, but we don't see much of the religion.

 Anyway, I started listening to the Kamadeva mantra very randomly, and I felt very connected to him, the same as I felt with Ganesha and Shiva when I first met them (and I'm devoted to them now). 

First, I searched and thought he was the God of Love, but now I was reading through some stuff, and I saw that Hindu people don't worship him because he represents lust. But I really didn't know that, and I only thought he was like a cupid or something. 

Now, I feel very confused because I really have good feelings about him, and I was thinking I was embodying the energy of love and finding love, not desire.

 Now, I don't know if I should continue worshiping him or if I should just stop and look for another deity who represents love because that's really what I'm needing. But I feel like I can't force these things with Hindu deities; I just feel like they choose me, and I don't choose them. But I'm scared I may be going in the wrong direction and disrespecting the deities."

1071,"I am a Hindu, throughout my childhood I’d go to temples with my parents and the usually weekly temple visit at my apartment. Didn’t quite question anything, it was something that made my parents happy and i loved the prasadam. Once I went to college, I really started to question a lot of things about god, the religion etc. there’s a lot of unknowns. I still go to temples if my parents ask me to and if they go anywhere. I’ve asked my parents why they pray to a god, my mom just kept it up outta habit, and she believes in all the powers and good energy. While my dad had a tough childhood and god was the one being he could confide in, so he kept going on with the relationship. Meanwhile I’m from a skeptical generation, a great childhood, and parents and friends to confide in. 

My current stance is that I don’t want to have blind faith, and I don’t mind continuing the practicing things of the religion for the sake of tradition. But ideally I’d like to educate myself better about the religion and make a decision about being more involved in it or just practicing it for the sake of continuing the tradition. When people say things like divine power, good energy, bad energy, cleanse…I really cringe at it cuz I don’t understand it from the perspective of science, being a big part of my education. I believe education has something to do with this cuz when I had talked to one of my uncles a couple years ago, who is really involved with reading Veda’s and scriptures. He had mentioned that in the early days, when students would study under gurus, that they’d have a separate part of education about spiritualism or such, I don’t quite remember.

1085,"Who is the greatest?. I see this question being raised often in this subreddit. So lets try to answer that.

I will put it straight out there before explaining anything : No Deity is greater than any other Deity. All can manifest themselves as the supreme.

Now, that my intentions are clear let me go into more depth as to why is it so?.

See firstly what you call as the Supreme is often described as : "" Para Brahman"".

Para means Supreme , Brahman means the Ultimate Reality. So essentially Para Brahman is that which is beyond mortal comprehension and is described as that which eternally pervades everything, everywhere in the universe and whatever is beyond even that , it is so high up there that even the definitions fall short of describing as what it is up to.

Now then , if you search you may hear that each sect or sampradaya has a different opinion on who is Supreme. Maha Vishnu, Para Shiva, Adi Parashakti, Para Bhairava. It is wrong to say that each sect wants to glorify one deity over the other, the differences within sampradayas are mainly to ensure that the sadhak doesn't get distracted and deviates from his path, otherwise there is no vitriol among the truly spiritual of each of the sects.

Because from the practical standpoint of view, by realization of many siddhas and great rishis. That which is supreme can be manifested by each of the great gods, because they are one and the same only.

Dont think of the Supreme as a different cosmic entity . Its simply the whatever deity you worship but in a higher state.

For instance Lord Shiva, which we worship is often depicted as the deity residing on mount Kailasha. Then we have Sadashiv, his higher aspect and form , the 5 headed one which is not usually worshiped in the first place. Then finally Param Shiva, as we discussed.

And this applies to all deities in some way or the other. Make no mistake their form is different, the deities are different and each can manifest themselves on each of the planes.

Of course this shouldn't cause any confusion among you all in regards to worship of the deities. If you are worshipping Lord Shiva then the karmas are being created in that direction only. And if you worship any other deity, you are building up with that only, since the forms and existence is different."

1093,"Lord Krishna, in the Bhagavad Gita, imparts wisdom on life balance and various aspects of life. He emphasizes the importance of finding equilibrium in all things. Here are some key teachings:

1. Duty and Detachment Krishna advises performing one's duties outcomes attachment to the outcomes. This means doing your best in your responsibilities but not being overly attached to success or failure.

2. Yoga and Meditation: He encourages the practice of yoga and meditation as a means to attain inner balance and self-realization.

3. Moderation: Krishna advocates for moderation in all aspects of life, including eating, sleeping, and work. Extremes should be avoided.

4. Material and Spiritual: Balancing material and spiritual pursuits is essential. While one must fulfill worldly responsibilities, they should also seek spiritual growth to find true inner balance.

5. Self-Control: Krishna emphasizes self-control and conquering the senses to maintain balance and avoid impulsivity.

6. Compassion and Non-Violence: He promotes compassion and non-violence as important aspects of a balanced and harmonious life.

7. Equanimity: Krishna advises maintaining equanimity in the face of success and failure, pleasure and pain, and all dualities of life.

Bear in mind that this is not a depression or sadness sort of emptiness. This is more like a ""There is nothing much in this world that matters"" kinda emptiness. It is like the emptiness in which you feel like you are just passing time before you go back home. 

Has anyone else felt this way before? If yes, what do you do about it? And am I doing something wrong which led me to feel this way?

Each year, I would find something a couple days before the festival and when I want to order it, it says it will arrive the day after the festival. This year, I decided to order the clay early(around April). But the problem with that is that all the natural clay that they sell online is in very large quantities but for very cheap prices. That or they sell very small quantities for very high prices. I was able to find 5lbs of clay for a reasonable price this year. This was the perfect amount for me, but I am not able to find the same link to buy fo next year. So my options are 1) Buy the PoP murtis(which I really dont want to do) 2) Buy the broken idols made of clay(which I can't use for puja ) 3) Spend a ridiculous amount of money buying a very small amount of clay(I'm not trying to be cheap. Its just a waste of money for the amount that they sell) 4) Spend very little money but buy a huge amount of clay (which I will have trouble maintaining and storing) or 5) Use the same clay as this year(Which I think is the best option for me) Can I do that?

Whatever you have done in the infinite number of your previous lives makes your **Sanchit Karma**. This is what all you have accumulated in your hard drive. Good, bad, ugly. Everything.

A section of this **Sanchit Karma,** say your total hard drive is 1 Peta Byte - 1 giga byte of this will be loaded into your existence when its time for you to reincarnate in a new body as your **Prarabdha Karma.** This is what we call fate. You absolutely have to experience whatever is in your Prarabdha. As you come into being, a continuous reading of your 1TB of data starts, and if there is good file arising out of good karma in your bank, you get a good experience, and if there is a bad file due to bad karma in your bank, you get a bad experience.

There is no way to escape this - our shastras say :

>*Avashya-meva Bhoktavyam Kritam Karme Shub-ashudbham*  
You will absolutely have to bear the fruit of all the Karmas you have done - good or bad

Now what you are doing in this life, what you do every moment you are awake is **Kriyamana Karma,** which in turn gets written to your Sanchit Karma file, as well as makes your swabhava and mind and samkara, and this is what you take with you - the sum total of your karmas in this life, when you die. This determines what will be your next destination.

You get Mukti (Sarshti, Samipya, Salokya, Sayujya, and Sarupya) once your Karma File is totally deleted.

The only way to delete your karma file is either through samkhya yoga (gyan yoga), Karma Yoga, or Bhakti Yoga.

Burn your earlier karmas. Do not create any new karmas.

How you can burn your old karmas? By naam japa, and naam japa only.

How can you stop creating new karmas - by stopping to identify with the body (gyan), by doing everything for the benefit for other and realise you are just giving back to the universe what is the universe to begin with (karma), or surrender yourself fully to the divine and make yourself his toy - he will make you do what he wills (bhkati)."
1119,"Hi, I’m a Sikh who has been learning more about Hinduism recently! Just wondering what you guys thought about the Sikh community? Thanks in advance!

 "
1120,"I'm a beginner. I have a lot of interest in hinduism and bought the Bhagavad Gita, as well as getting one from the library that has explanations which makes it easier to understand. The thing is, although I have a lot of interest I don't know where to begin. I would love to because when I read the Gita I feel like I learn a lot that benefits me and it's knowledge that I will hold in me forever and cherish. I feel like the religion I am involved in, I don't feel like I learn as much, and I dont value the things I do end up learning if that makes sense. And the one thing I will say is that with reading the Bhagvagad Gita, and praying and meditating I feel the most peace I've ever felt. It is led with confusion not going to lie, but that confusion urges me to sit down and piece everything I am confused about together. How can I begin? Are there somethings I should know as well? Thank you for your help"

1123,"Not sure if this is the correct sub for this. I’m gonna also post it on the Buddhism sub. 

If God split herself into all these different vessels to play within herself, then why are we trying to “become one” / enlightened again? Didn’t God purposely split herself, to play? Would it be impossible / pointless to ever “become one” again ? Because maybe she doesn’t want to become one again because that would end the game? If we are already God then what is the point of becoming enlightened when we are ALREADY God. We can’t become any more GOD than we already are ? 

I just occasionally find myself feeling like “it is pointless to try to become enlightened” because if God WANTED to be ignorant and play, then who am I to try and counteract that by becoming enlightened and ending the play?

1124,"I'm making a web comic that involves gods from different ancient cultures. Greek, Roman, Hinduism, Norse, Egyptian, Pre Islamic Arab, Chinese and Japanese. The thing is, I know how to draw the others and they basically look like the people from their countries. This is because the only people who worshiped those gods were from those countries so those gods were just based on the looks of the people. For a long time, Hindu gods were depicted to look like Indians. This changed when Hinduism spread to other parts of the world Like Japan who redrew the gods to look Japanese.

The way that I am thinking probably is more accurate to the original texts and it is important to make the gods look accurate as it is part of a very important concept in my comic (New gods and Old gods). There are some gods who are described as having skin as white as the moon. I don't know if it would even look right for a god to have pale skin while having Indian features. The honest truth is, I don't even know if Hindu gods are meant to look Indian. I have tried looking around and sources just say that they are formeless and it doesn't matter which isn't helpful. The most common thing that I have seen on the Internet is making Hindu gods a mix of Indian features and western design. These designs actually look good but I'm not sure. 

The hindu gods won't appear until around chapter 5 so I defintely have time but I want to find a style now so I can practice and get used to it so I can do it properly by the time I get to chapter 5.

1150,"I am neither Hindu nor Sikh, but I am curious on what you think of all the Vaishnava names found in the Sri Guru Granth Sahib?

I have been listening to a lot of shabad/gurbani kirtan, and although I know that Sikhs worship the nirguna aspect of God, Akāl Purakh, I was surprised on the Vaishnava names for God. I guess bhaktas such as Nāmdev and Rāmānanda contributed, and the bhakti movement was contemporaneous with Guru Nanak dev ji.

(In my Sanskritised renderings,) In one shabad, I heard: Madhusudana; Damodara; Hrshikesha; Govardhana-dhari; Mohana; Murali; Manohara; Madhava; Krishna; Murari; Jagadisha; Narasimha; Varaha; and Vamana. https://youtu.be/WXwKdBJlGoI?si=gqp0yirRTkiRvKaR

And in my other listenings, I have heard: Narayana; Mana-mohana; Govinda; Rama; Hari; Kanhu (Kanhaiya); Dina-dayal; Shridhara; Gopala; Shrinivasa; Vasudeva; Vishnu; Achyuta; and Parabrahma. 
https://youtu.be/WDBn-yJbjig?si=lo3JlxUDJiVs3JtF

There's even reference to Draupadi and Ganika; to Prahlad Maharaj, and Dhruva Maharaj; names of which which can only be understood if you are familiar with Hindu literature. 

I think it's rather beautiful because the Sikh idea of God is very close to my own idea. Although God is beyond form ultimately, He has many names, from Hashem to Allah to Waheguru.

And Waheguru? It's 'Va' for Vishnu; 'He' for Hari; 'Gu' for Govinda; and 'Ru' for Rama."

1152,"I was reading the Purva Mimamsa Sutra of Jaimini, and came across this definition of Dharma. What do non-Vedic or post-Vedic philosophy adherents think of it? How would you define Dharma, if you differ with the definition given by Jaimini?"
1153,"From what I've read, we have to go through 840k lives to ultimately attain the ""gift"" of human birth. But I never asked to be born. I don't want peace, or happiness, or ""moksha"". I just want to cease existing. The only way I can do that is by taking my own life. However, according to hindu scriptures, this act has karmic repercussions. Why should I have to conform to these rules that I never wanted to be subject to?

I mean, I don't get how this is fair. Not every human being has a life worth living. So all those births and cycles of pain we go through just to attain the so-called privilege of having a human body, isn't it pointless? At least a cockroach's life isn't so complicated. Its nervous system isn't as developed, it doesn't even feel pain when crushed. Isn't that better than being in a constant state of despair and sadness? I really cannot see how my being alive is good in any way. I've been depressed for several years now, unable to feel any amount of happiness, yet my religion tells me to just ""endure"" it? And for what? How am I supposed to follow my ""dharma"" when I don't even know what I'm supposed to do and why I even exist?

As a human, I get some amount of freedom with my physical state where I am not a slave to my instincts. However, the ONE thing I want to do, that is, take my own life, becomes a sin? Shouldn't the privilege of having a human body also come with the privilege of having the freedom to forsake it?

Sometimes, I really wish I were an unempathetic, ignorant atheist. At least that way I wouldn't be burdened by this information of the damnation that would follow me after I kill myself, at least I wouldn't be affected by the pain my actions would inflict on the people I love. But no... As a Hindu and as a human being, I'm not designed to even feel that way. That's my whole point... This is all a cruel joke."

I recently had the opportunity to read the translation of the Kannada book ""**Mahabrahmana**,"" written by Devudu Narasimha Shastri, who is also a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award. 

In his work, he beautifully narrates the Puranic story of Vishwamithra and Vasistha.
Also the story of Trishanku and Vishwamitra.

 Author, is a spiritual seeker and a Veda Upanishad scholar, skillfully weaves the essence of the Upanishads into the story, highlighting the magnificent power of the Gayatri mantra. 

He presents a Puranic tale in the form of a novel infused with profound spiritual teachings.

 He was able  witness and hear the conversations of Devas  once in his life.  


**Never miss to read the Preface.**

**This is a story book for a story reader.**  
**This is a spiritual guide for a spiritual seeker.**  
**This is a guide for academics.**

*However, I was unable to locate a Hindi and Other translation of this remarkable book. I firmly believe that such a literary gem should be accessible to a wider audience. If you happen to know of any leads regarding a those  translation or anyone who might, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share the details.*"

1160,"But why most of these holy places are soo dirty and ill maintained. Shouldn’t those are the most cleanest places to visit?
It’s a minimum basic necessity.
Like for every other major religion, there most holy places are soo clean. 
Is that because of people mindset, government maintenance or not enough funding by Hindus themselves?"
1161,"This question might sound naive to some, which is justified as I've just started reading about vedanta and exploring hindu phiolosophy and other schools a bit, and I only know and understand the 101s at this point.

With that being said, I wanted to know what is vedanta's explanation, if any, of everything that's happening in the material world?

From what I've read till now, it's clear to me that this body/ego and the material word, which is encompasses the body as well, is temporary and the cause of all our sufferings. The word ""dharma"" means righteousness; giving up pleasure for doing what is right; doing your duties.

But who decides what is right and what are our duties?! This is a highly subjective matter, I believe, of deciding what is right and wrong for oneself and what are their duties. People pick things up for themselves, and this choice is highly dependent upon one's senses, one of them being mind. Mind, being a sense organ, will be dependent upon the surroundings and/or subjective reality of a person for its stimulus/stimuli, and will process and take action(s) upon stuff in alignment to the things that it believes has believed till date.   

Coming to the next point: material world is temporary; agreed! But it seems like a statement that kind of shrugs off the efforts it took humans to build this civilization up, if you look at it this way. Humans developed complex social systems, theories, architecture, etc. and all of this, I think, would have been quite difficult, to some extent, if any of the people had this mindset of abandoning the material world for it is the source of all sufferings and is temporary.

Would like to know what you all think about this. Thanks."
1162,"**My argument is that Ganesha the populair god was not officially part of the ‘’pantheon’’ In Hinduism.

My post is not to hurt any religious sentiments but rather to make us Hindus aware that we need to be more critical in our approach of the scriptures especially the highly interpolated Puranas. Because of the complexity of the subject, this post is going to be long so please take time to read before commenting.** 

&#x200B;

**The real origins of Ganesha?**

**Madhukar Keshav Dhavalikar, M.A., Ph.D. (University of Poona) explained in 2016 trough his his book about Ganesha, explaining the rise of the elephant- headed divinity from a sacred animal and an animal totem to the exalted** **position of a cult deity in Hindu pantheon. This long journey of a tribal god from gaja to gana to Ganesa to** **Maha- Ganesa and a cult deity, as great as Siva and Vishnu, His popularity in a large** **measure is due to his being a vighma-karta (obstacle-creator) changing into a vighna-harta (obstacle-remover).**

Yuvraj Krishan is one of the academics, stated flatly of Ganesha, ""He is a non-Vedic god. His origin is to be traced to the four Vināyakas, evil spirits, of the *Mānavagŗhyasūtra* (7th–4th century BCE) who cause various types of evil and suffering"". Krishan notes that the rat is destructive and a menace to crops. The Sanskrit word *mūṣaka* (mouse) is derived from the root *mūṣ* (stealing, robbing).  It was essential to subdue the rat as a destructive pest, a type of *vighna* (impediment) that needed to be overcome. According to this theory, showing Ganesha as master of the rat demonstrates his function as *Vigneshvara* (Lord of Obstacles) and gives evidence of his possible role as a folk *grāma-devatā* (village deity) who later rose to greater prominence. A.K. Narain writes that ‘’ On the other hand, there are doubts about the existence of the idea and the icon of *this* deity"" before the fourth to fifth century A.D. ... \[I\]n my opinion, indeed there is no convincing evidence \[in ancient Brahmanic literature\] of the existence of this divinity prior to the fifth century’’. The evidence for more ancient Ganesha, suggests Narain, may reside outside Brahmanic or Sanskritic traditions, or outside geocultural boundaries of India. Ganesha appears in China by the 6th century, states Robert Brown, and his artistic images in temple setting as ""remover of obstacles"" in South Asia appear by about 400 CE. He is, states Greg Bailey, recognised as goddess Parvati's son and integrated into Shaivism theology by early centuries of the common era in the Gupta region (not in the south). 

The worship of Ganesha was only well established by the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Gupta period and had inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Gaṇapati became inducted into the Brahminical pantheon relatively late through the Gaṇāpatya sect in the 1st millennium AD when it came into prominence. He was probably connected with two groups of early folk divinities, Yakşas and Nāgas according to Coomaraswamy (a theory now contested). Though this cult never became of such importance as some of the other major cults, in His current iconographic form, the elephant-headed, pot-bellied God came to be regularly worshipped, especially after the late Gupta era while the itihāsapurāna was already established. This was the approximate time when the first literary/scriptural references to Gaṇapati are found in post-Gupta literature, where He begins to be associated with the Śiva-Śakti cult through the interpolations and inventions of purāṇic accounts of his origin. **Siddhānta astrology, which became dominant under Babylonian and Greek influence around the third century A.D. added a new dimension to the cosmic evil with which men had to contend: the planetary forces that were believed to shape an individual’s destiny. As protection against inauspicious movements of the Navagrahas, the nine heavenly bodies, the most effective counter-measures were held to be the performance of special, elaborate rituals, the graha pūjā or graha hōma — which weren’t always accessible. Thus the worship of other protective gods and goddesses was formalized to meet the needs of all socal classes. The cult of Vināyaka or Gaṇeśa was perhaps the most successful of these substitutes called on to meet the threats of both terrestrial and planetary forces of evil for many by which Vināyaka or Gaṇeśa became more and more famous.**

 

**Late and interpolated texts**

Ganesha Purana and the Mudgala Purana are verly late and interpolated puranas. Some scholars say the core of it came into existence around the 12th and 13th centuries, being subject to interpolations during the succeeding ages. R. Stevenson, in contrast, suggests the text was likely written in or after the 17th-century after having studies this purana.    

Also the Ganapati Atharvasirsha which identifies Ganesa with the Brahman  is of a very late origin, while Courtright and Thapan date it to the 16th or 17th century. The text even exists in several versions. (All Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda are of a verly late origin and exists in several versions). Note that THIS is the most important surviving Sanskrit text of the Ganapatyas cult, wherein Ganesha is revered!

&#x200B;

**Somaskanda a medieval form of iconography. No Ganesha?**

This family depiction of Shiva originated during the 6th-8th centuries CE during the period of the Pallava in South India. The representation shows Shiva with four arms and Uma (Parvati), and between them the infant Skanda (Murugan) is shown as dancing with ecstasy. Not surprisingly the elephant god who’s iconography and symbolism changed over time, as already discussed above is not part of the family as his origin lies in the former Gupta region where He also was absored in Hinduism trough the interpolations of purāṇic texts. Over a period of time, a number of such depictions have been discovered from different regions that were once under the control of Pallavas. These orthodox and staunch devotees of Shiva would of course knew if he had 1 or 2 sons don’t you think?

  

**End remarks:** I peronally think that the reason why many Hindus today say that Ganesha must be worshipped first before the commencement of any religious or secular undertaking is because, He after an already ancient but complex origin, was at first absorbed in Shaivism because of there medieval rivalry against Vaishnavism who had a similar method with the deity Vishvaksena, who is worshipped first in the Vaishnava sects like Sri Vaishnavism. 

I also assume that after my post any argement that Ganesh is mentioned in the Vedic Samhitas as ‘’Ganapati’’ can of course not be taken seriously?!  

I hope i have not insulted the devotees of Ganesha nor other Hindus so please leave a comment if you want but pls keep things respectful and show me if a got something wrong. "

1164,"According to the Ramayana, Lanka is located 100 yojanas from the southern tip of Bharat. 1 yojana is roughly = 13 kms. So Lanka is 1300 km from the southern tip of India. This distance is far more than how far modern day Sri Lanka is from India. Lanka is also considered an island fortress, which would mean the island has to be far smaller than what Sri Lanka is for it for the entire thing to be a Fortress. Added to this, other than the Ramayana, no other text refers to the island of Sri Lanka as Lanka. It has always been called Sinhala since the earliest sources mentioning that country. This sinhala got bastardised by the Europeans and became Ceylon. It's only after independence from Britain that the Sri lankans started calling themselves Sri Lanka. 

So is this another case of a country adopting a name from one of the two ancient Indian epics for it to have a higher status? There are plenty of examples of kingdoms in Indian history that adopts a name of a kingdom mentioned in the epics to legitimise their role in the politics of Aryavarta. Examples are Pragjyotishpur (Assam), Tripura and Manipur. All these three kingdoms in their modern day territory were not involved in the epics. There were however kingdoms that had those names who were involved in them. We know this because the locations of these kingdoms mentioned in the epics is totally different from their modern day location. They adopted those names and tried to trace their lineage to the kings of those legendary dynasties to legitimise themselves as true Hindu kingdoms. Is Sri Lanka just another example of it? If it is, they're a unique case as they only adopted this name in an era where legitimisation from a Hindu cultural sphere isn't necessary unlike the case with the previous countries."

I was drawn to Hindu spirituality when I was young. I became a vegetarian and practiced celibacy out of my own will during my teenage days. I started to adopt some spiritual practices and followed them ardently. 

I'm in my thirties now and am yearning to have a love relationship now. But I feel very guilty to have such a yearning. 

Because, I have read that Hinduism teaches us to practice detachment from worldly desires. These worldly desires might cause us to take rebirth again. Which is why it is making me feel guilty to have a love relationship. 

Maybe I have misunderstood Hindu teachings and might be having a wrong understanding.

Is it wrong to desire love relationship as per Hindu scriptures?

I look forward to your advices and opinions.

1170,I have seen many ancient Hindu texts and sometimes they have art near the words to depict certain parts.

Can I still practice these methods for communication and searching for divine inspiration/signs from divinity or ancestors? Are there folk traditions in India that reflect similarities? I can’t find much online."

1185,"Reddit wont let me crosspost this. Originally from r/theshamsharmashow

In Bhagavad Gita Chapter 2, Verse 26, Arjuna's questions were Buddhist's questions, not I, ISKCON's founder Prabhupada has written this in his true form in Srimad Bhagavad Gita. Pada does not stop here in his explanation and describes Buddha Dhamma and its branch Vaibhasika as older than Arjuna and Krishna, that is, he accepts that Gita was composed when Buddhism was fully mature. Further, nihilism and Vaibhashika's non-acceptance of soul are also said to be accepted by scientists and America. And the most important thing is that Prabhupada explains his Gita Bhashya as it is. In the same way, the newer something is, the older it appears to be. Like the authors of Puranas kept the name Purana i.e. old. Moolshankar Tripathi (Trivedi) alias Dayanand Saraswati founded Arya Samaj in 1875AD and translated Vedas in 1881AD (approx) and said Vedas to be more than 1 billion 96 crore years old. Whereas written evidence of Vedas was found in 1464AD. Now the question is, who propagated the 5000 year old Geeta?"

1194,"When I see temples they mostly use statues based on older art. This makes sense as these temples are already old. The thing is, I haven't seen any newer temples using new art. I have seen many Hindus get offended about the idea of using new art. The thing with new art is that they are able to use their modern understanding to make things that look more like what events in the past would have looked like. For instance there are many flying chariots in the texts and when these were painted they were just normal chariots in the sky. With more of an understanding of these, many artists have made art relating to these while looking more a long the lines of how these were described.

I constantly hear about the importance of art and literature in Hinduism. People talk about the golden age of Hinduism and praise its advancements in architecture, writing and art yet many want to stick to the old way of drawing when we could always use our knowledge (from scholars) to make art that better represents what actually happened in the past or what gods look like. 

 When I see modern art of gods I feel like it is a better representations since people make them in ways that are more like their descriptions and better project their beauty as well as strength.

At the end of the day this is a subjective thing with no right or wrong answer. Some probably stick to the old style of drawing found in old paintings because they are considered sacred. This is fine and if something is fine then there is no need to change it. Personally I prefer the newer styles because I feel like I can make art that would better represent what things actually looked like while it was happening."

1198,"Hello Friends,  this has been a bit of a gray area for me and leads to my daily puja's taking a long time so I thought I would check in with what might be a stupid question. So here it goes.

When we do pranam or touch our forehead to the ground after the end of puja, what are you thinking and how long is it supposed to take? Like for me, I try to envision the feet of all Gods (and their consorts as applicable) while I am down on the ground. Is that how it is supposed to be? Because given the large number of Gods we have, this takes a lot of time. I have also seen some people just bow down and get up instantly, which led me to think maybe I am doing it wrong and this is just supposed to be a symbolic gesture where you signal your devotion and then get up.

However my parents aren't very aware of it and I think there are hesitations and misconceptions about inadvertently performing it in the incorrect way.

I have two questions:
1. Are there specific, easy-to-follow tarpana rituals that can hopefully done without too much fanfare at home, and are gender-agnostic? 

2. Are there specific rituals prescribed to pacify certain tendencies that run in the family? For eg. I feel there is a streak of anger on the dad's side that has flowed down from before my grandparents' time. All my father's siblings and cousins have it, gender no bar.

1209,"Today marks the culmination of a two-month journey for me – I've finally completed reading the Bhagavad Gita. It took me a total of 15 days, with some on-and-off reading. Just to clarify, I focused solely on the English translation of the slokas, without delving into the commentary.

Reflecting on this experience, my feelings are quite mixed. Some chapters proved to be incredibly complex, leaving me struggling to grasp their depth. However, as I made my way through chapters 17-18, I had a moment of realization. The recurring theme of ignorance seemed to be pointing at me. To sum up my understanding, the book seemed to be emphasizing phrases like ""worship me only,"" ""break the cycle of endless rebirths,"" ""Stoicism,"" ""let go of material attachments,""

These phrases are like the major catchphrases, but the Bhagavad Gita also offered more profound insights, such as the idea that one shouldn't be overly concerned with the results of their actions, and the importance of shedding guilt.

I had some prior knowledge of Stoicism, but this journey added depth to my understanding. Interestingly, I found that reading the Gita at 3 am, during those moments of heightened motivation, spirituality, and solitude, made the experience even more profound.

Now, here's the question that lingers: If I don't agree with everything in the Bhagavad Gita, does that make me ignorant? [maybe this comment will help you understand my mindset better](https://reddit.com/r/hinduism/s/hJb7fRUh4E)

> *god doesn't help anyone , we human have free will that's it.
matter of fact god aint even real it just something we human have create by self gaslighting ourselves into thinking there is someone to help us or guide us
all holy books are literal self help books - these books are made to help us to understand ourselves better like our emotion , mindset towards thing etc
every success we get in life it because of hard work or other person mistake or just pure luck 
the earlier you know the better

But it didn't feel right cuz I hadn't taken a bath and didn't feel clean. This automatically gave rise to a lot of questions on my mind-
1. Should you read Bhagvad Gita when your body is clean or just anytime?
2. Should you read it or just listen to it?
3. Is a Guru/Mentor necessary for its correct explanation? Cuz I think we may correlate its verses incorrectly. Or can it be done alone as translations are mostly available.
4. If you have Bhagvad Gita at home where is the correct place to keep it (I don't have a Puja room).

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) 2023 में कब और कौनसी तिथि है?

**पितृपक्ष का आरंभ 29 सितंबर 2023 से हो रहा है और इसका समापन 14 अक्टूबर 2023 को होगा ।**

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध):

**सनातन धर्म में पितृ पक्ष का अधिक महत्व है। पितृ पक्ष को पितृपक्ष, 'सोलह श्राद्ध', 'महालय पक्ष', 'अपर पक्ष' के नाम से भी जाना जाता है। तमिल में पितृ पक्ष को आदि अमावस्या, केरल में पितृ पक्ष को करिकादा वावुबली और महाराष्ट्र में पितृ पक्ष को आदि अमावस्या के नाम से जाना जाता है।**

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) का मतलब क्या है?

**पितृ पक्ष का मतलब है कि पितृ को/का पिंडदान करना या तर्पण देना | हिंदू धर्म में यही मान्यता है कि पितृ जिनकी मृत्यु हो चुकी है वो अश्विन माह की प्रतिपदा से लेकर पितृ कार्य अमावस्या तक मान-समान एवं भोजन प्राप्त करते हैं।**

 

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) 16 दिन के क्यों होते हैं?

**पितृ पक्ष पूर्णिमा से अमावस्या तक 16 दिनो तक रहता है। किसी भी व्यक्ति की मृत्यु इन्हीं 16 दिनो के अंदर ही होती है। इसी कारण पितृ पक्ष सोलह दिन का होता है।**

 

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) में क्या मंदिर जाना चाहिए ?

**पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) में सुबह जल्दी उठ कर स्नान करके ही नियमित देवी - देवता, भगवान का स्मरण करना चाहिए और उसके बाद ही ब्राहण को पिंडदान करना चाहिए |**

# पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) में क्या दान करना चाहिए ?

**पितृ पक्ष (श्राद्ध) में काले तिल के दान को विशेष महत्व दिया गया है | काले तिल के साथ चांदी की कोई वस्तु, अन्न, कपडे, गुड़, गाय का घी, जूते -चप्पल आदि का दान किया जा सकता है |**"
1226,"The God of Abrahamic religions keeps an account of your good deeds and bad deeds and punished and rewards you accordingly. Unfortunately this BS ( pardon my French) has also seeped in to current Hinduism, probably due to  hundreds of years of foreign invasions.

 And The most unfortunate part ? It has also become part of some of the modified Puranas which go at length to describe how you will be fried to death post death. And the so called Pandas are sharing this BS, misinforming and creating unnecessary fear in the minds of innocent seekers. 

Many a times I find Naastiks happier than Aastiks. Reason being while they do not understand spirituality but atleast they are also not carrying the unnecessary baggage of BS on their heads.

Now let’s look at what Gita has to say about the nature of the Creator / Ishwara:

na kartrtvam na karmani
lokasya srjati prabhuh
na karma-phala-samyogam
svabhavas tu pravartate (chap 5; verse 14)

The embodied spirit, master of the city of his body, does not create activities, nor does he induce people to act, nor does he create the fruits of action. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature

nadatte kasyacit papam
na caiva sukrtam vibhuh
ajnanenavrtam jnanam
tena muhyanti jantavah (chap 5; verse 15)

Nor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone's sinful or pious activities. Embodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which covers their real knowledge.

In essence you have complete freedom to direct your life the way you want. No one controls you but you. 

Then how does Ishwara respond? Or what is your connection with him? 

samo 'ham sarva-bhutesu
na me dvesyo 'sti na priyah
ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya
mayi te tesu capy aham (chap 9; verse 29)

I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him.

In essence the creator responds to you only when you are overflowing with love. This is the only time when the grace descends otherwise you are free to lead your life the way you want without any interference.

This is the ultimate catch. While Ishwara isn’t judging you in any way neither your good or bad actions but once you are in love, intense love you are naturally good. Not morally good but naturally good. It becomes your swabhawa.   

But because he isn’t judging where is the point of fear? 

Aum Shanti"

1249,"To be completely honest, I struggle with faith. But I am definitely a theist. Now, I have a trouble choosing my Ishta Devata.

My family has a history of Dattaguru devotees and in my region, Dattaguru and Datta Sampradaya is very prominent. And for a lot of time I considered him to be my favourite deity as he was the Guru, also combination of the Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, thus essentially encompassing all 3 major deities. I used to go to a nearby Dattaguru Temple and used to read some scriptures of the Datta Sampradaya. However, I was not doing it consistently as a Sadhana.

Few months ago, I started developing weird attraction towards Bhairava, especially Kaalbhairava. And I vowed that I'll chant Kaalbhairava Ashtakam 11 times every day for 40 days and will visit a prominent Kaal Bhairava temple. And I did that. I don't know what made me make that promise or why I did that and how could I manage to do it consistently over the period of 40 days. But I did it.

Since then whenever I try to start Upasana of any other deity, I suddenly lose interest in it. And I get drawn to the Kaal Bhairava only.

I don't have any issues with worshipping Kaal Bhairava, but I'm not finding enough resources. I know the Ashtakam, Bhairav Chalisa and the Bhairav Nama Mantra. I know that Bhairava devotees observe fast on Ashtami tithi of Krishna Paksha. But other than that, I know nothing and can't find a proper way of doing anything.

Am I stuck (in sort of a good way) with Bhairava, especially Kaal Bhairava? And if yes, how do I keep worshipping him?

Also, I used to consider myself a follower of Advaita Vedanta philosophy. How do I reconcile these 2 things?"

1251,"Shraadh- Pitra Paksh what is it❓

Re- Birth is a phenomena that is scientifically proven and accepted post a lot of research and experiments. Energy is all pervasive and cannot be destroyed but it can also not be stagnant and is constantly changing. In this process of evolution also lies the process of life and death. This is nothing but the soul moving from one physical being to another form. 

After we die we transition into another level of energy or to another plane than the Earth. The Bhagwat and the Purans mention various planes of existence with Earth being one of them. The Soul after leaving the physical body moves on to other planes. The terms mentioned for other planes in the Vishnu Puran and Bhagwat references to- “Lokas” and Talas. 

The higher frequency planes are “Lokas” and the lower ones are “Talas” the all-pervasive order and law of Karma deciphers the forward journey. 

The family in which we take birth into is also part of this and hence is Karmic. When our family members depart from Earth they move on the other planes as mentioned above but they still hold the ability to bless us or sometimes hold anguish. This further affects our own patterns of Karma. 

The simplest way to create harmony in our families and Ancestral Karmic Patterns is performing- “Shraadh” 

Shraadh is a fifteen day period, also called Pitra Paksh from Full Moon- “Purnima” to New Moon- “Amavasya” at the time when Sun enters Virgo. The natural 6th house of the zodiac indicating sins and emancipation of Karma.

Being the Sixth division of the Zodiac Virgo symbolises- Purity, and Sins, or purity from sins. Hence, during this solar transit we remember the departed souls and pray for emancipation of their sins, cleanse our own karma by good deeds and clear our own sins and karmic debts. 

This powerful ritual frees families of sufferings and bondages and specially benefits those who are suffering with issues of childlessness, dead children, misscarriages etc. 

The simple process is to invite a Brahmin and his wife home for a pure vegetarian home cooked whole sum meal, offer a prayer in the name of the departed family member and gift them with clothes, fruit, money etc. It is believed that the benefit of this donation and positive karma reaches those who are no longer with us. 

One is supposed to perform individual Shraadh on the tithi of Death of the ancestor. So if your grandfather passed away on the 9th Lunar Day (Naumi) you perform the Shraadh on Naumi. 

On Amavasya a collective Shraadh is done for all ancestors, Prayer to the Sun (Tarpan) is performed for peace and healing and donations and good deeds are done. 

This year’s “Pitra Paksha” or Shraadh period starts on the 29th of September. Do this powerful ritual this year and bring peace to your life and family. Connect with Astro Kanu for updates and more. Much love.

This year, again after a week, something horrible happened which I don’t wanna disclose.

1255,"There are many other religions around the world that have scientific facts in their books. Christianity says that it was the fallen angels who went to the other nations and revealed forbidden knowledge. Islam says that Allah sent 124,000 prophets around the world and many of the prophets were misinterpreted. In Islam the prophets have supernatural abilities and people say that these powers were seen to the people as godly abilities which is where the mythologies of the world originate from.

I know some people claim that the Buddha is an Avatar. Many do not believe in this. I have even seen some people claim that Jesus was an Avatar of a certain god. This is the only way that I have seen Hindu scholars and Hindus online theorize how the other religions know things that they shouldn't. I also remember someone claiming that the lost city of Atlantis may be from a Hindu Text since there is a city that closely resembles it. Other people use the great flood from Hinduism to explain that every religion originates from Hinduism since the flood is in nearly every religion."

Sruti stands for Vedic knowledge. Here Krishna says to Arjuna that when the multifarious interpretations of vedas stop disturbing your mind and your mind becomes stable, inspite of all the wrong knowledge, you have attain samadhi. 

Many people I know suffer from their misunderstandings of scriptures themselves. Not entirely their fault. But this is something Krishna pointed out to Arjuna 5000 years back. A problem which still persists in different forms.

1259,"So I'm 28 yrs old male who is soon getting married to the love of my life by the end of this year.


Me and my girlfriend always wanted a very simple wedding but we wanted to follow all the traditional rituals.
Anyways the wedding our family has planned is a bit more stylish and grand than we were hoping to do but nothing we can do about it anymore as they won't listen to us.

But we now wish to design our own wedding card ""kankotri"" for our marriage.
We both are designers and earlier we have made few wedding cards for other people.
Our theme has always been more about informing other people about the rich heritage and the rituals which are part of the marriage ceremonies... 

And naturally for our own marriage we wish to do the same as well, we do not want a flashy jagmag wedding card but rather an engaging and memorable wedding cards for our guests.

Last time when my gf made a wedding card for someone, she took the theme of miniature paintings and she designed small rectilinear cards with miniature style painting depicting important ritual and on the other side it had simple shlokas and it's translation.

We want to do similar kind of things for our wedding card as well, but instead now we wish to depict with a different medium, 

So suppose there are rituals such as baraat, madhuparka, kanya aagman, Kanya daan, hasta milap, varmala, mangal phera, saptapadi, etc etc etc... 
We wish to depict those particular rituals graphically which are either mentioned in mythological stories, or in important historical events, or in folklores.... 
We may be able to get such kind of folk paintings or artworks which represent those stories. 

In simple words we want our wedding card to be memorable even for others and not just a fancy piece of paper which they will discard after reading the dates and looking at it for awhile...
And at the same time it may be able to inform people like me who has no idea about this cultural traditions and rituals.


So I wish to find knowledge people who can help me find and inform me about these kind of events, rituals.
Like if you know any particular event from epics or in some other folklore which might have these rituals inside those stories, it would be pretty good exercise to turn that into a visually appealing graphical narration...

So yeah I'm not sure if my post conveys my intentions clear enough, but I suppose we will see. 
Anyways thanks for the help."
1260,"Namaskar redditors,

I need your help. 

I tend to hold on to a difficult past rather tightly. So much that it has disturbed the possibility of good things happening in my life. 

I have tried everything. Turns out therapy and meditation helps and I have come a long way since a concrete narration of - ""my past defines me."" 

However, I very often fall back into the old patterns. I hate being in that space. There's acceptance and there's realization. But I want to let go. I want to surrender to the lord and to the possibility that I too deserve good things in life. 

I'm grateful for everything Mahadev has given me and protected me from. But somehow I find it difficult to surrender.

**How have you done it?** 

**What has your thought process been like?**

Any advice/suggestions are appreciated. 

Thank you!"
1263,"There is an increased enthusiasm among the youths about our dharma(at least within  the social media).I see hundreds of reels and yt videos everyday.Wheather it be Krishna,Shiv,Ram,Shakti or Hanuman,many have started as a devotee of them and are also chanting Random Mantras(also those that require initiation).What is your view on this?Do you think it is effective for introducing the religion to the youths and also westerners or is this a wrong approach?"
1265,Like there are approximately 6 orthodox astik schools. I feel that at least in the north advaita Vedanta is the most popular one. If you do follow a specific school of thought.

1267,"I have been apart of sanatana dharma (consciously) for a little over a year and the concept of vaastu shastra seems almost impossible to follow or properly research.  It seems like people have conflicting opinions, so, my question(s) is this.  What are the most significant rules? I am moving and will have to have a mandir that is smaller than my puja room so can I just use a shelf?  Should I cover it? What are home mandir etiquette if you can’t have a whole puja room?  Do I have to follow vaastu strictly?"
1268,"I'm prone to bouts of feeling extremely down and it sometimes leads me to question existence and everything..

I get really really angry at ""God"" for creating everything. Why is there this whole circus in existence? Is God not satisfied with his unitary existence? Is it a sadist God? Why are there people suffering really badly all over the world? Fuck the so called law of Karma. It makes absolutely no sense. At what point in evolution did the Karma start to be tracked ? 

And some people might talk about Advaita Vedanta which kind of says that this is a temporary illusory reality, but it doesn't make this reality any less real to experience...

So why does this whole circus exist? Is there any definitive answer in Hinduism?

Edit: I am not mentally disturbed in any way. Ita just that from time to time, my spiralling thoughts make my view of the world, god and everything to get shaken from the very base."

1274,"I don't know why suddenly many Hindus are calling themselves Sanatanis. Doesn't Sanatana Dharma also includes Buddhism, Jainism all those Dharmic religions? Also people are making mistake that Sanatana means eternal and constant but it's not. It's eternal and cyclic. In India some Tamil Nadu leader's son is using the term without knowing what it is. He is talking about Jati Varna Ashrama Dharma but using the word Sanatana Dharma for it."
1275," The way to surrender to the supreme is — one, accept without protest, realize that whatever is happening is happening as per karma. Karma is the universal law that governs the universe. And we have to accept whatever is happening as karma. The second step is to realize that we are not this body-mind-ego that is governed by karma, we are the Divine Soul. This realization is the way to surrender to the Divine. As long as we are the body, mind, ego, we can never surrender. Because the body, mind and ego will refuse to surrender. It is only the Soul that can surrender. Therefore, that awakening, spiritual awakening or enlightenment, leads us to a state of complete surrender, where we live in a state of consciousness, experiencing eternal bliss, in the truth consciousness of being the Soul — this is the ultimate surrender that comes from awakening.

1280,Which books should i read in order to learn about Vedanta.
1281,"The genus of bos (tribe bovini, family bovidae) includes a range of different type of cattle that anyone would describe as cows and bulls. It also includes different types of bison- the American bison, the European bison, and a South Asian bison that's mostly found on the subcontinent. It also includes yaks.

These bison are often capable of interbreeding with each other, the same goes for the yaks, and all of them can at least attempt to cross breed with cattle- your regular cows and bulls. There are some combinations that lead to infertile offspring of one sex or the other, but the other sex can be bred back into the gene pool. Other combinations yield fully fertile offspring, and those combinations have been done on purpose sometimes at an industrial scale, either for the purpose of yielding a better or healthier type of meat for people to eat or to produce a hardier animal that can better survive. Sometimes these cross-breeds work out better in the wild than the pure breeds, and that's been the case in Australia, the US, and Europe with different sub-tribes in different places and at different times.

According to Hindu teachings and beliefs, are all of these animals regarded in the same way? Are yaks and bison and water buffalo- for example- held in the same level of regard as the more common and familiar Brahman cow?

One additional question- beef is something that Hindus obviously cannot eat for religious reasons. Does the same go for bison meat, or yak or water buffalo or whatever else? Is there any meaningful distinction between the meat of a pure bison and that of a beefalo (around three-eighths bison) or a bison hybrid, which is more likely at least half bison? Is it all the same thing, basically, or does the religion parse out meaningful distinctions within the genus?"

Though I have an interest in Hinduism. And it definitely looks appealing. But I'm bisexual. I've heard some parts of Hinduism are very pro-LGBT like most American Hindus are very progressive, but some are very homophobic. I want to be a active bisexual man who has sex with both men and women. I'm heteroromantic, so I plan on marrying a woman but having bi MMF threesomes with her and another bi guy as well as having casual flings with men on the side with her consent. Is Hinduism ok with that?

But back to the topic at hand, I'd love to worship all the Gods and Goddesses in Hinduism. And I think Brahman could be my idea of pantheism or panentheism. I believe in a conscious ""planner"" God who is the consciousness of the universe and the universe is his body. This is similar to the Logos of the Stoics, the God of the Sikhs, various ideas of God in Sufism, or the idea of tzimtzum in Kabbalah. But is this what Brahman is? Does Brahman think on his own? Or is he a latent hivemind? I've heard of personal Brahman that sort of implies Brahman can be conscious. But is personal Brahman still pantheistic? I have a lot of questions. "

i don't believe every story is real. i also feel that some things that might've happened in ramayan and mahabharat are exaggerated. it could be with life lessons, these texts also want to be a source of entertainment. at least, i find them superbly entertaining purely from a literature pov. i really love the plot building and character development of these 2 texts, especially mahabharat."

Why doesnt god help those that get murdered or raped? Were they not praying enough? 

What about the poor , who pray themselves to death , believing that one day, maybe they'll become financially stable , and be able to provide basic nutrition to their family? 
 
i have seen people describe or justify this with ""karma"" , but should a 3 year old baby girl be raped and murdered because she did something in her past life? 

does a person deserve to have his family raped and murdered in front of him, just because he did something in his past life (that hes unaware about in this life?) 

if this is indeed karma , why punish the criminals, when they were only performing their duty as a mere pawn to karmic justice? 


This might sound very naive , but please note that this is coming from someone who is genuinely curious

Shiva and Parvati

Legend says 
The world was created by Lord Shiva and Goddess parvati is his other half.

Lord shiva & parvati are one soul. He splits his soul Adi Shakti into other half, she takes birth as Sati, daughter of Daksha Prajapathi.

If we crack the story, goddess Parvati in sati avatar always attracted to Lord Shiva. But Lord Shiva was a runner, Sati had to take so many tests & clear so many obstacles to reach union with Lord Shiva. Though, Lord Shiva knew that she will get separated one day from her in physical way, he couldn't resist his love & had to accept her.

Is this not describing the Twin Flame phenomenon of today?"
1296," 

***Ganesha and his elephant head***

The birth story of Bhagwan Ganesha or Ganapati is found in the Shiv Purana and Ganesh Purana. The story goes that Bhagwan Shiva had entered the state of samadhi for months together and Goddess Parvati yearned for company. She then decided to have a son and created Ganesha out of her body’s clay, rubbed out during her bath. The etymology of one of his names Vinayaka, means born without the male element.

One day while taking her bath, she tells Ganesha to guard the door against anyone coming into the home. At that very moment Lord Shiva comes after completing his long meditation and tries to enter his home. Ganesha not knowing Lord Shiva is his father denies him entry and a fight ensues in which Shiva beheads Ganesha. When Goddess Parvati sees her beheaded son, she is furious and tells Shiva to restore Ganesha’s life immediately. Shiva kills an elephant which he encounters first and replaces Ganesha’s head with that of the elephant.

It is not expected of a mighty god like Shiva to react in rage to a boy like Ganesha and behead him. The Hindu Puranas are woven in symbolism and metaphors. Ganesha was created out of clay. Clay has certain impurities. Impurities stand for the ego. Ganesha represents an advanced sadhaka. Shiva represents the guru. The guru eradicating the ego (impurities)of the disciple is akin to beheading him. The ego is beheaded and not the neck of the disciple. Enlightenment which then ensues due to the illumination and personality shift is represented by the elephant head.

1303,"A revisit to the glorious Chandogya Upanishad over the last few months has helped refresh my memory and this time I was more focused on linguistics and minute details in Shankara's commentary. The importance of this gifted life is surprisingly brought out well while also highlighting the need to have rigour in one's Dharmic practices.

The aim of Advaita is always Jivanmukti, absolute non-difference; about the recognition of the self-evident 'I' as the Supreme Brahman by the individual. And the Upanishads double down on this.

With regards to the objection that one while still living in this body cannot experience absolute Bliss, [Sruti says](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/chandogya-upanishad-shankara-bhashya/d/doc1145359.html),

# अशरीरं वाव सन्तं न प्रियाप्रिये स्पृशतः

meaning that the unbodied is not touched by Pleasure and Pain.

Shankara in his commentary clarifies this further by showing that once the Jiva realizes they are not the body-mind and so bodylessness being one's true nature, no afflictions can affect them because any cause and effect, of merit and demerit can cling on to someone who is not attached to body-mind. There is neither pleasure nor pain any longer as such, so all karma is transcended as also clear from the popular Mundaka Upanishad mantra. Here the pointer is towards all dichotomies including creator-created, which can be overcome.

The more direct point of contention that even Advaitins fail to digest and keep circumventing for various reasons is the notion of pushing Brahman away as some 'God' and further placing agency for creatorship on Brahman. I've seen Ramakrishna mission folks also misrepresent Advaita in this manner.

And as is the case of using the Vyavaharika - Paramarthika distinction as actual, Shankara himself makes it clear that relative is absolute, so the non-separability has to be accepted, Brahman is the 'I' shining forth, and the Jiva (individual) should realize it as this moment itself, as oneself.

Prajapati's continued exposition with Indra is to serve this purpose and so the objection of Brahman as some separate Supreme Being is dismissed and as a consequence the supposed union of Jiva and Brahman, the example that people casually throw around to misunderstand Advaita also is dismissed, because it is not an equation but rather the realization that I am already the absolute, there *never was a time* when I was the body. Another reason why Turiya/Brahman, the fourth, is not a separate state is also given by Shankara here. It is lived reality for the Jiva.

## >तथा भूम्नि ‘अहमेव’ (छा. उ. ७ । २५ । २) इत्यादिश्य ‘आत्मैवेदं सर्वम्’ इति नोपसमहरिष्यत् , यदि भूमा जीवादन्योऽभविष्यत् , ‘नान्योऽतोऽस्ति द्रष्टा’ (बृ. उ. ३ । ७ । २३) इत्यादिश्रुत्यन्तराच्च । सर्वश्रुतिषु च परस्मिन्नात्मशब्दप्रयोगो नाभविष्यत् प्रत्यगात्मा चेत्सर्वजन्तूनां पर आत्मा न भवेत् । तस्मादेक एव आत्मा प्रकरणी सिद्धः

# >>Further, if the ‘Infinite’ were something totally different from the living Self then the text would not have asserted that ‘I alone am in the Infinite’, and then gone on to sum up with the declaration that All this is Self’;— specially in view of another Vedic text, which says—‘There is no Seer other than this’;—nor, in that case, would all the Vedic texts have applied the term ‘Self’ to the ‘Highest Person’ (Supreme-Self); if the ‘living Self’ (counter-Self) of all living beings were not the same as the Supreme Self. From all this it follows that the Self dealt with in the present context is one only.

Nowhere is Brahman made out as some god who is alone real but rather that the Jiva who recognizes bodylessness as their true nature, lets go of the wrong notion of body-mind and realizes themselves as Brahman. And since the Devas and Gods and deities also meditate on the Self (CU 8.12.6)

# तं वा एतं देवा आत्मानमुपासते तस्मात्तेषा

there is no need to concede a separate creator at any stage, at least as understood per Adharmic religions. It however doesn't mean we can't accept a creator, but the caveat should be Lila, the play of the Self - 'I' which gives meaning to everything, and so Advaitins while not *succumbing to everything is the same rhetoric*, accept the diversity while noticing the non-difference. Acknowledgement of creation, destruction in relative reality does not affect the Jiva who has the vision of realizing Blissful reality in this life. Shankara says at the end this can be achieved by everyone in this life - that they are Isvara itself."

1315,"Ik Hinduism is very broad but I've been a Bhramin Hindu and the diety my family has been following has been of Narasimha (my parents are from near Udupi natively). I though am looking for a branch of Hinduism that would be less restrictive on what I'd be allowed to do (eating meat including beef [ik Kerala is lenient on this, not heavily emphasizing Karma as I don't agree with it fully and think it's a victim blaming mentality, one that would be lenient on drug useage, etc) or I'd consider another Dharmic faith like Sikhism or Jainism or Buddhism and maybe later on even look into some Roman religions but for now I'd want to stick with Hinduism."

1332,"   I believe that many contradictory things can be true at once, for instance if energy in a closed system cannot be created or destroyed (which means systems of it cannot be created since they would require every minimum unit of energy to be created as a closed system) as the first law of thermodynamics states, combined with cause and effect (not the principle of causality, but the colloquial idea that things that happen need other things to have caused them) in infinite regress (since a cause requires a cause) then at some points in infinite regress it would have created minds capable of controlling the universe, or things we could call Gods. 

   Since none are present in the observable universe there must have been a beginning, with something making the call as to the chances of a universe popping into existence, which implies minds, or things we could call Gods. 

   If they are in infinite regress and no minds were created that we could call Gods by those two systems, then they must have been joined together at a specific moment in time, and since the only thing that can cause two eternal, stable natures to change is a choice by things capable of controlling two universes, not just one, or things we could call Gods. 

   To that effect I am told that in physics there is a problem that is incomprehensible by us, that there are rules for large things that its individual parts do not obey (general theory and quantum physics), in other words the law of non-contradiction is not native to this universe, therefore many illogical things are possible, like the realities known by all the sages of polytheist religions (or complex unity religions like Hindic religions).

   Personally I believe that you have a duty to practice the faith of your ancestors, but praising other Deities is perfectly fine if you admire them or if you need their help. My main practice is a combination of Germanic Paganism (indistinguishable from Norse Paganism but in German) and Zapotec/Kiche Maya syncretism, namely in worshipping Woden, Freyja, and Kukulkan. I also pray to Thor when Tornadoes are near. Furthermore, I believe Logic is a gift from the Gods.

   I hold nothing  but love for Hinduism and India. May you all prosper under the light of Surya all of your days."
1334,I have heard that every direction has a Protector. A Deva. I do not know how many directions are counted : 4? 8? 10 (= 8 plus above and below)? Maybe there are various traditions.  I imagine each God has a mantra for this task of looking over a direction.  I do not know if Hindu Temples are sometimes arranged architecturally according to this logic. Do some Hindus have rituals to honor the Protectors of Directions?
1335,"I start seeing signs of Lord Krishna everywhere whenever I think of Him. Some of the instances that have happened to me

Instance 1: I was riding in an auto rickshaw and as I was contemplating Lord Krishna and the next I saw was a painting of Krishna on the pillar of a bridge. 

Instance 2: I was in a crowded metro and again I focused on Krishna. A few minutes later I saw a man's phone wallpaper which has his child dressed as Laddu Gopal. 

Instance 3: I was in the office cab and once more,I thought of Krishna. At that moment I noticed a girl wearing a bracelet with ""Radhe Radhe"" written on it.

Instance 4 : I was just walking through  a flea market, meditating on Krishna and suddenly I saw a basuriwala selling basuris while playing  right in front of me.

Instance 5 : This time on Raksha Bandhan one of my sisters  tied a rakhi on me that had an image of Lord Krishna on it.

I have asked this question to other subs also. But couldn't get any answers.

1344,"Hello!
I have been listening to Acharya Prashants interpretations and while some of his talks on Gita sound more clearer than others, he said something (grossly) incorrect the other day which made me chuckle tbh. 

So as per him and his interpretation of the Gita,  ‘nothing leaves the body post death’. Like seriously ? So he just denies the existence of “sookshma sharira” Well he is entitled to his views and this absurdity probably sounds closer to Buddhist texts, but him saying that no where in the Gita is it written that the spirit leaves the body post demise is at best laughable! 

Krishna cannot be more clear about this with multiple verses dedicated to the subject, one example includes:

ajo 'pi sann avyayatma
bhutanam isvaro 'pi san
prakrtim svam adhisthaya
sambhavamy atma-mayaya

“Even though I am unborn and inexhaustible, as the Ishwara of all that is living, in the nature I am myself established and incarnate as Atma through my internal potency.”

I am really not sure what this gentleman is up to 

Om shanti"
1345,"I see most Hindus having trouble defending Hinduism from accusations of casteism. I will now provide scriptural arguments they may use.

Now the Bhagavat Purana 7.11.35 says this:

“If one shows the symptoms of being a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya or śūdra, as described above, even if he has appeared in a different class, he should be accepted according to those symptoms of classification”


Now people might try to override this by quoting a text from a Dharmasashtra that says that A Brahmana is someone who is born from 2 Brahmin parents or such. For example, Manu 10.1:

“ Among all castes, those only who are born of consorts wedded in the natural order, as virgins of equal status, are to be regarded as the same (as their father).”

However this is misleading because this argument fails to describe what exactly a Brahmana is. It is like telling a child that a cow is something that is born from two cattle parents. See how circular that is? Granted cows have visible features to say that it is a cow, but do human castes have those physical features?

In fact Medhatithi writes under that verse something like this.

“Who are these that are called ‘Brāhmaṇa’ and the rest? We cannot perceive any difference among men. The determination of the caste is dependent upon a knowledge of individuals belonging to the caste; and individuals, devoid as they are of any knowledge of the disposition of the component atoms, cannot indicate any difference among the castes. Nor is there any difference in the figures of the ‘Brāhmaṇa’ and the ‘Kṣatriya’ as there is in those of the ‘cow’ and the ‘horse,’ for instance,—by virtue of which the said castes could be perceptible by the eye Nor are the said castes discernible by any other acts; as, for instance, the nature of the oil or the melted butter can be discerned by smelling or tasting. Nor again can the difference among them be discerned by differences in such details as those of purity, conduct, colour of the hair, and so forth; because these details are almost always found to be mixed up. Further, actual usage is dependent upon men, and as men are mostly deceptive, the character of anything cannot be ascertained by a mere reference to them.”


Now admittedly Medhatithi’s says conduct and virtue can’t determine a caste. This may seem against our purpose but remember all of what Medhatithi is saying is that you can’t determine caste based on perceptible means.

Medhatithi also writes:

“ What the present text does is to declare,—in answer to the question who is a Brāhmaṇa?—that ‘he is one born of a Brāhmaṇa;’ and this is exactly as if, on being asked—‘what is a crow?’—one were to say ‘it is what is born of a crow!’ In fact, it is still to be known what is that ‘Brāhmaṇa-hood’ that belongs to the father.”


But how does Medhatithi reconcile the paradox. For him, and several other Brahmana pandit, it is tradition and/or lineage.

“ It has been urged that what is here stated is illogical But this could be so only if the matter of castes were something negotiable by direct perception. As a matter of fact however it is something that can be determined only with the help of Smṛtis, and as such must be as they are declared to be in these texts. Just as in the case of such titles as ‘Vaśiṣṭha’ and the like (family-names), it is found that, even in the absence of any blood-relationship with the personage named, they are applied to men on the basis of uninterrupted tradition handed down from times immemorial; and serve as the basis of such expressions as ‘the Vaśiṣṭhas are listening.’ And the case of the castes also should be taken as standing on the same footing. Just as in the case of a number of Brāhmaṇas, all of whom are equally ‘Brāhmaṇas,’ they are classified as ‘Bhṛgus,’ ‘Vatsas; ‘Bhāradvājas,’ and so forth—such distinction being based entirely upon ‘Smṛti,’—so in the case of a number of persons, all of whom are equally ‘men,’ they come to be distinguished as ‘Brāhmaṇas,’ ‘Kṣatriyas’ and so forth.”


However we aren’t obliged to follow Medhatithi’s solution, nor that of any commenter. All we must take away from this is that Manusmriti’s declaration of caste and birth is NOT a contradiction against Bhagavatam. We can interpret it as if the 2 parents have the same QUALITIES as a Brahamana, the child will be of Brahmanical Qualities and thus a Brahmana.

Blind tradition on one’s caste is not only not falsifiable, but it is also on the order of “we believe we are this since ever with no doubt”. Besides it is near impossible to prove your ancestry back to Lord Brahma as being unbroken.

And forget the Brahmanas, what about the other castes.  AI Advaita Manu was born a Kshatriya. All who decend from him are Kshatriyas. Where are there Shudras from? We’re they fallen Kshatriyas? Again that is a matter of qualities and not birth."
1346,"our ancestors describe universe basics, consciousness basics, nature based observations in such a sophisticated way. Meditation, yoga, medicines, understanding of sensuality, buddism etc born out of people minds with relatively little material wealth. 

Our traditions, though colorful and diverse actually serve as a drag on the superior awesomeness and universality of Hinduism. From our traditions and rituals, casteism, wife burning , obssession with gold, unbreakable feudal systems etc many bad features of our culture were born. Albeit, many positive things from our traditions, were born too, music, our unique attire, languages, etc

Hinduism, though I hate to call it a religion, is a way of thinking that can adopted in yourself without having to subscribe to a temple, church , group etc.

So I pose the question to the group, is our Hinduism Philosophy greater than our traditions and rituals?"

Not saying all jains or buddhists are bad,many of them are devout hindus. However i believe they support us because we are in majority and they feel safe.

1370,"Instead of jumping to scriptures and reading, begin with understanding your own blood line - what gods does your clan worship? How? What other rituals have your ancestors followed? If you can, go to your ancestral village and talk to elders there. 

The best way to learn about the personal dharma and sanatana dharma in general is to study the lives of the older generations who are still connect to their roots - instead of calling them as “backwards”, try to only see what you can learn. 

Another great idea is to read about the lives of saints- how they lived their lives.

I'm not very religious in practices , tho I do wanna devote more of my time to God but my hectic schedule currently doesn't allow me to do so however I'm still very much religious to the core n inner self . I do chant Lord Shiva and calls out for Lord Krishna often . Whenever i visit any temple i just start crying , even if I'm not sad or thinking about anything sorrowful yet tears just start flowing . This happens in every temple i visit regardless of the deity . I'm a young teen so it's not like I've struggled much or lost anything precious or depression...Sometimes it just feels like my heart aches ( of sorrow ) when i cry there but I'm not conciously sad but yet I feel like I wanna cry more - it's so confusing - why do you think this might happen ?
Another thing kinda buzzing me up is that - a few days ago I heard a bell in my ear , no it's not that tinnitus teeeeeeeeeee one haha it's clearly the crisp sound of that heavy temple bell that we ring when we enter the temples , yes that biggg one . Yes I'm sure there was no other voice or any bell nearby me . Then after that I heard a faint flue sound in my ears for a good moment. Btw no I have no hearing issues I swear- 💀I don't have tinnitus ! These sounds were so natural n clear as if someone was producing these sounds right behind me . I'm kinda confused n wondering if this might be sign...??? Sorry guys this might sound stupid and superficial. I just thought it might be a sign since recently I had an atheist phase💀and i literally called out God one last time asking him to guide me back to religion if he wills or I'll follow the path of atheism tho I still had a gleam of slight hope but yet very very skeptical about it ( I'm sorry this is not the wisest choice ik but that time I was extremely frustrated with my life n a degrading mental health ) and guys literally somehow I embraced religion again- I feel like this post will get too long so just lemme know if u wanna hear the whole story in the comments 😅🙏Thank u !!!"
1372,"So i have been getting reacquainted with our beautiful faith and I was watching some videos from various Hinduism channels and i'm getting a little confused over some of the ways described to avoid karmic baggage.  

One thing shared was the need to have proper/good motives and attitudes in the choice of actions and thoughts one has about situations people etc.  And the other i find **seems** like it contradicts with that is the need to be dispassionate in how we act as to not bring on ourselves any further karmic baggage.  The confusing bit for me is how do i remain dispassionate while having compassion for all created beings (atmans?) etc. while being dispassionate.

Forgive me if i am not communicating myself well, still relearning some of the terminology.  As a monist i recognize we are all like drops from the ocean of Brahman. (when I heard this particular metaphor i found it so helpful) So i recognize the need to be there for others as much as i am able to respect the unity we all have in Brahman."

Namaste. So I am not rlly new to sanātan dharma as someone born into a hindu family. I always loved listening and learning about bhagavān but never knew much about the deeper spiritual aspect and what it rlly means to be on a path of bhakti and realization until 1-2 yrs ago. 

Shrimad Bhagavad Gita and a few other purāns were like a blooming moment and my perspective about a lot of things changed, especially abt the reality of who we are and how should we approach life and our own self. I would say I am generally a good kid but my views abt life was basic with heavy expectations, disappointments and resentment. So after learning all that, I became more determined to change my approach to life and dedicate myself to bhakti (i pray to bholenath mostly but my beliefs are more likely of a smarta). I have a VERY long way to go but I wanted to start somewhere.

Well, I knew it wont be very easy but didnt think it would be this hard to stay consistent either. The thing is one of my main weaknesses is anger. I dont snap at small things or stuff like that and I would say my anger is triggered due to some awful circumstances but I realised that to be truly in the path of bhakti, I will have to let go of this ""justified anger"" too and that is proving harder than it is. I can control myself sometimes but other times I just see red and i feel guilty almost immediately cause of this (little) ""awareness"" i have of dharmic teachings. I try to stay calm the next time but i slip out again. Oddly enough, i find more reasons to get angry after i decided to make changes with how i wanted to live (prolly overthinking lol). When i do puja, i feel at peace and honestly i rlly feel some kind of connection with bholenath which is why I feel guilty when I cant be a good bhakt to bhagavān. So how do you guys practice what you learn? More so, how do you stay consistent? Not just about anger, but generally everything else?"

So far what i learnt mostly forgot the point from earlier chapters but so far it talking about Stoicism

And also treat everyone as you treat god which is no possible in todays world im just curious let me know

1386,"The purpose of Mahabharata was to get rid of all the Khastriyas who had become sinners. Earth had complained of the weight of sinners she had to bear. And supreme Lord promised her that he will take avatar and rid her of this. That avatar was of course Lord Krishna.

If I look at it now, it seems to have not worked at all. Pandavas rule was just 36 years if I recollect correctly. And soon with end of Parikhshit, Kaluyga started. And things went to worse.

Have I got it all wrong?"
1388,"Hello, 

I am writing this because I don't know anything about my heritage and culture. I was born in the USA and don't speak Hindi. My father is a very business minded person with little value for religion. My mother loves our culture and religion but living in a country other than India I was never fully educated on how to be a good hindu. I went to India this year for the first time in 8 years and I am ashamed how little I know about my culture. 

Please tell me what I must do, what I must read, and what I must practice, so that I can learn about my past and be enlightened about my purpose."

1393,"I am taking an Asian religions class this semester at my university. My professor said that down the line he will want us to do a research paper. I thought about maybe doing a research paper about the Bhagavad Gita for my research paper and also because it was a book that intrigued me. I’ve heard it’s a book that has inspired many famous people and other regardless of what you believe in.

I read the version by Edward Vilojen except to me this was a book that was meant to prepare you for the actual Bhagavad Gita and it provided some useful background information I could use for my research paper about the Mahabharata. It summarized the chapters in the Bhagavad Gita but it just didn’t feel like enough to satisfy me if that makes sense. 

My professor suggested that to read the version with the commentary written by Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The problem with the two versions I’ve read so far is that to me when I read the chapters summarized by Edward Vilojen it made me interpret the Bhagavad Gita as just a typical religious text and what you’re supposed to do to praise Krishna. I’m currently reading the one my professor suggested and I’m reading the second chapter. So far the commentary just feel too much to me if that makes sense. It makes reading the story feel more like a chore to me, and also because I think it will be too long for me to read and complete my research paper in time.

I think also one of the problems that I’m running into is impersonally not a very religious person and I like when the book or commentary starts talking about souls and what to do to become more aligned with Krishna it just doesn’t appeal to me. I feel like  I might be reading into the book too literally because other people have many interpretations for this book that I don’t seem to be seeing. 

What are some versions of this book that I might enjoy more and that are more appealing to everyone?"
1395,"Have you ever thought how Mahatma Gandhi can read non violence as the core of Geeta when the first teaching of Krishna to Arjuna is to rise, fight and kill since the spirit is immortal. Have to ever thought how so many people take to the path of Sanyaas or acetic life when the narration of Gita is to a Grihastha or a man who lives in the world. 

In my opinion true learning from the Geeta is that you are absolutely free to choose your path. True teaching of the Gita is to be able to speak with your own self and find out what’s right for you, to write your own Gita narrated by your own self. 
Aum shanti"
1396,"So when i was practicing Advaita Vedanta before leaving Sanatana Dharma my belief about reincarnation was mostly fixed on the idea that reincarnation (samsara) is a much?)  more merciful a situation than a living consciousness (atman?)  only having a single life to be worthy of being Saved or made one with the divine (i would use the term Brahman currently without hesitation as a monist) as in abrahamic faiths.  

But at this Juncture i would like a deeper understanding of how this was arrived at as part of our faith.  I have read the Bhagavad Gita and I know Krishna taught it to Arjuna.  And the vedas speak of it as well as our other Sacred texts (Upanishads, puranas etc.)  but i'd like to get a better handle on the reasoning and a better idea of how the atman experiences(or doesn't experience) the process of what happens upon death and the way reincarnation affects the atman (i know that from what i have read most, at least, have no recollection of their past lives) I know that an atman's karmic status determines what form of life and circumstances they are born into but i would really appreciate a lot more detail.  

If someone could walk me through the details on the process of reincarnation i would really appreciate it.  I get the feeling that Brahman is the ""active agent"" in ""determining"" whether, where, and how the atman  should be reincarnated but i am really fuzzy on this and why apparently there is a period of time between reincarnations of a specific atman and whether during that time the atman might be perceived by people they were close to as a spirit/ghost etc,)  

I know this is a lot of questions.  I appreciate any and all help to better understand this topic."
1399,"For context: I’m a woman in her late twenties, married, have space and time in my home for multiple pets (and I have 3 pets).

I try very hard to stay away from the superstitious aspects associated with Hinduism like “don’t cut your hair on Friday” or “don’t travel in Tuesdays” because I feel they I still an unnecessary fear.

Anyways, when it comes to pets, I only see info about how you should be kind and feed them, but not keep them as pets. 

But shelters are full and cats and dogs there are in cages. Isn’t it kinder and more compassionate to bring some home and take care of them like children?  

If we are to have outdoor cats (which seems like the solution), how can we justify knowing that they may be killed by cars or humans or taken back to the shelters? 

And, if we are only entitled to our actions and not the fruits of the actions, then shouldn’t we not be concerned with all the consequences (like going to hell, bad karma, tortured)?

Isn’t it better to show love and compassion to these beings than to just leave them in shelters for the sake of our own karma? 

However, I still struggle with not allowing dogs and cats to live outside as they please. Neighbors tend to have a problem with dogs being outside. A lot of dogs that were inappropriately bred to live in climates they’re not suited for (I.e. huskies in Texas) can’t cope with the climate outside and without proper training they become dangerous.

There’s so many things I can’t reconcile but the scriptures are pretty clear on “keeping animals inside the home is bad”

How do you guys make sense of this?"

1403,"Hi Everyone,

I have recently been on a journey to learn more about my Indo-Caribbean & Hindu roots. I come from a more predominantly Afro-Caribbean background, but part of my maternal side of my family is of Indian descent, who were indentured labourers. 

Unfortunately, we didn’t learn any cultural & religious traditions; that side of the family is unknown.

Any advice on how I can start my journey of learning about Hinduism?

1404,"1. Suppose that there is a Monk who as attained a state of pure bliss and love by removing all sense of ""I"" and ""Self"" from his being and consciousness.


2. Now suppose that this Monk commutes through a village one day, and encounters a hungry Child who begs for money, to which the Monk obliges.


3. Now suppose that this Child is actually a sadistic practitioner in occult dark magic, who secretly plants a demon into the Monk against his will, at the very moment that the two touch each other's hands.


4. Now suppose that in the following months, the Monk has completely lost his blissful and loving state, and has begun to exhibit behaviors of laziness, frustration, and psychosis, all as a direct result of demonic possession, cast upon him against his will by the sadistic Child.


Now my question is, How and Why was this Monk so spiritually vulnerable to outside forces, despite him having already been in a state of peace and enlightenment attained by erasing all sense of ""I"" and ""Self""?

Why was this not enough to protect the Monk from such a spiritual attack that has caused him to completely regress and devolve in all ways?"

1407,"I would like to recommend the book ""Music and Mantras"", by Girish.  It features a plethora of information on how to improve our singing and devotional practice, and provides dozens/hundreds of Hindu mantras in the back that we can use to tap into various divine energies.

1409,"Hello there everyone I would just like to state that I have never been truly religious mainly very critical of it because I could not comprehend how anything can truly make logical sense, but due to recent events, I have experienced a so called ""paradigm shift"" where I have somehow logic-ked my way into believing in Hinduism.

I showed this image that I made of my current understanding of the universe (to the best of my logical ability) to some people and they said its reminiscent of Atman and Brahman and looking into it this subject I realised THIS IS MY EXACT WAY OF THINKING. How is this possible. Am I crazy?"

I also have ancestors and family who are K'iche Maya and Zapotec, in fact my great grandmother spoke Zapotec and my father claims to speak some K'iche though I have no way of proving that. I admire Hinduism and its intuitional and yet deep understanding of the universe. I also recognize that both of my ancestral pantheons, ancestors and animal spirits have different stories of creation, and they are both very different from Hinduism, but we don't know everything about the universe yet, so I think all three narratives could be true.

1427,"Besides ""Metaphysics And Tantric Esotericism Of Krama An Analytical Exposition"" by Navjivan Rastogi (and amazing work by the way) what other books are there to expound the doctrine and philosophy of the Krama school?

1428,"Okay, i know i am asking this very clumsily. But is there a sort of universal Sanatana Dharma method of meditation that helps a person reintegrate their identity with Brahman in a way that is not adding a lot of layers of required preparation or learning before engaging in the practice of meditation but is also a form of meditation which in and of itself is able to also be useful for the long term or current lifetime.  So something basically a 'beginner' could do but which an experienced practitioner would not find constrictive or too basic.   No offense intended but i feel very clumsy trying to explain my meaning coherently here.     

Lots of previous methods i researched seemed like there were alot of things you already had to be doing or understandings you already needed to have in place(prerequisites).  Or they required a ton of discipline to achieve anything near what  might be considered ""good results"".   Now i am not looking to escape the need for knowing one's faith or having good discipline, but i have discovered about myself that if i can find simple ways to practice my faith i don't get mired in so many doubts doing things the ""right way"" and my low self esteem doesn't get me depressed about my chances of ever being good enough to properly engage in a spiritual practice.   My current or proximate\* ishta devas are: Hanuman(Shiva), Ganesha and Ram(Vishnu)

 

&#x200B;

\*When i say proximate i mean that i am newly beginning to re explore Sanatana Dharma so I am basically at a new beginning in my journey previous to my current exploration i was basically practicing Advaita Vedanta with Krishna as my Ishta Deva and found chanting Hari Krishna mantra helpful then but Advaita Vedanta wasnt a good fit in the way i was practicing it tho i was careful about finding authentic sources to grasp the philosophy/teachings from.  So this time around i began with being strongly drawn to Hanuman and Ganesha, and reading Sundara Kand has led  to me feeling also drawn to Lord Ram.  So this is my current status spiritually speaking.  Trying to get some good practices to help my growth and exploration.  One thing I am certain of is my general philosophical framework is monism with focus on identifying with Brahman manifested as Hanuman, Ganesha and Lord Ram.  Any assistance you might be able to give me would certainly be appreciated!

1431,"This question emerged from a latest discussion, On the scale of Universe, we are not even a strand of hair. The Universe is \~13 Billion years old, We will hardly get 80-100 years. In this time period we have to learn basic survival skills, Look after our family, witness deaths of our beloved, endure favouritism, racism, hatred , scams from other Humans. What can we even do ? What does the Bhrahman expects us to perform ? How do I live and make my life fruitful and complete the purpose of my life as intented by him ? "

1433,"Râmânuja divides the universe into Chit, Achit, and Ishvara — man, nature, and God; conscious, subconscious, and superconscious. Shankara, on the contrary, says that Chit, the soul, is the same as God. God is truth, is knowledge, is infinity; these are not qualities. Any thought of God is a qualification, and all that can be said of Him is ""Om tat sat"".

Shankara further asks, can you see existence separate from everything else? Where is the differentiation between two objects? Not in sense-perception, else all would be one in it. We have to perceive in sequence. In getting knowledge of what a thing is, we get also something which it is not. The differentiae are in the memory and are got by comparison with what is stored there. Difference is not in the nature of a thing, it is in the brain. Homogeneous one is outside, differentiae are inside (in the mind); so the idea of ""many"" is the creation of the mind.  


Differentiae become qualities when they are separate but joined in one object. We cannot say positively what differentiation is. All that we see and feel about things is pure and simple existence, ""isness"". All else is in us. Being is the only positive proof we have of anything. All differentiation is really ""secondary reality"", as the snake in the rope, because the serpent, too, had a certain reality, in that something was seen although misapprehended. When the knowledge of the rope becomes negative, the knowledge of the snake becomes positive, and vice versa; but the fact that you see only one does not prove that the other is non-existent. The idea of the world is an obstruction covering the idea of God and is to be removed, but it does have an existence.  


Shankara says again, perception is the last proof of existence. It is self-effulgent and self-conscious, because to go beyond the senses we should still need perception. Perception is independent of the senses, of all instruments, unconditioned. There can be no perception without consciousness; perception has self-luminosity, which in a lesser degree is called consciousness. Not one act of perception can be unconscious; in fact, consciousness is the nature of perception. Existence and perception are one thing, not two things joined together. That which is infinite; so, as perception is the last it is eternal. It is always subjective; is its own perceiver. Perception is not: perception brings mind. It is absolute, the only knower, so perception is really the Atman. Perception itself perceives, but the Atman cannot be a knower, because a ""knower"" becomes such by the action of knowledge; but, Shankara says, ""This Atman is not I"", because the consciousness ""I am"" (Aham) is not in the Atman. We are but the reflections of that Atman; and Atman and Brahman are one.  


When you talk and think of the Absolute, you have to do it in the relative; so all these logical arguments apply. In Yoga, perception and realisation are one. Vishishtâdvaita, of which Ramanuja is the exponent, is seeing partial unity and is a step toward Advaita. Vishishta means differentiation. Prakriti is the nature of the world, and change comes upon it. Changeful thoughts expressed in changeful words can never prove the Absolute. You reach only something that is minus certain qualities, not Brahman Itself; only a verbal unification, the highest abstraction, but not the nonexistence of the relative."
1434,"I've noticed a lot of chatter and mixed opinions about Paramahamsa Vishwananda--- I wanted to share my perspective, backed by firsthand experiences and some facts.

  
**Guru-Disciple Relationship:** If you're familiar with the guru-disciple dynamic, you'd understand its profound depth. It's not just about teachings; it's about a spiritual connection that helps disciples transcend their ego. Yes, a guru might come across as stern or demanding, but that's often directed at challenging the disciple's ego, a core aspect of many spiritual paths.  


I've personally been around the sangha, attended the kirtans, and interacted with the community. The energy is uplifting, the people are genuine, and the teachings resonate deeply. I'm not alone in this; tens of thousands globally share similar sentiments.

  
**Misinformation:** It's puzzling to see negativity online, especially when it doesn't align with the experiences of so many. From what I've observed, a lot of the negative chatter seems to be from a handful of individuals, perhaps with their own reasons or agendas.

  
**Cultural Understanding:** Before forming opinions, it's essential to understand the cultural and spiritual context. Sanatana Dharma and the guru-disciple tradition have ancient roots, and a quick online search might not capture its depth.

If anyone's genuinely curious or skeptical, I'd recommend spending some time with the community, attending a few sessions, or even having a chat with someone who's been closely associated. It's always better to base opinions on firsthand experiences rather than hearsay.

Peace and love to all. 🙏"

This means that by once chanting the holy name of the Lord, one can be freed from the reactions of more sins that he can even imagine performing. The holy name is so spiritually potent that simply by chanting the holy name one can be freed from the reactions to all sinful activities. What, then, is to be said of those who chant the holy name regularly or worship the Deity regularly? For such purified devotees, freedom from sinful reaction is certainly assured. This does not mean, however, that one should intentionally commit sinful acts and think himself free from the reactions because he is chanting the holy name. Such a mentality is a most abominable offense at the lotus feet of the holy name. Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ: the Lord’s holy name certainly has the potency to neutralize all sinful activities, but if one repeatedly and intentionally commits sins while chanting the holy name, he is most condemned.

1444,"In the famous composition of Sri Annamacharya, *Nigama Nigamantha,* he says

*Divijendra Vandya Sri Tiruvenkatadrisha, Navanita Chora Sri Narayana*

The meaning is *Praised by deities and Indra*, *Lord of Venkatadri, the stealer of butter Sri Narayana*.

We can see the contrast between these two. In the first half, Annamacharya sings how Bhagavan is the one praised by the mighty deities like Devendra. But in the second half, he calls Him the thief of butter. It says that how the Mighty Lord of the universe also does seemingly mundane, common things, like stealing butter. This is the peculiar quality of Bhagavan which draws everyone to Him. 

We find many such comparisons in the scripture and compositions of devotees.

1445,"I recently took one of those online Ishta Deva website things (I know, I know) and it came up with Venkateshwara. Now, reading about Venkateshwara it says, ""The deity possesses the power of the Trimurti: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, and some sects believe that Venkateswara holds the power of Shakthi and Skanda as well. Sage Annamacharya praised Venkateswara as the 'Supreme Lord' who appears as Dattatreya for yogis, Shiva for Shaivas, and appears as whichever form the devotee desires.""

So, is it possible/appropriate to also worship Shiva through this deity, ""or whichever form the devotee desires"" and still be devoted to and showing obeisance to Venkateshwara/Vishnu or is there something that I'm missing or overlooking.

1454,"Today is my Reddit cake day and one full year of being a Hindu. To say my life has changed in the past year would be an understatement. I am filled with a profound, immeasurable peace. I have a connection with the divine I never thought possible. Most of all, my life is illuminated by bhakti to Lord Krishna. As I fill myself up with more and more teachings, wisdom, and knowledge, I become more empty. I have reached that place where the lamp burns steadily, unaffected by wind. That’s not to say that life has been easy, and there have been any challenges over the past year. But through Bhagavan I have met these challenges and reached greater heights than ever before. I started a new job and a new career, learned a new language, made so many new friends….but it is not about me. Everything is in service to God.

If you’re new on this path too, my greatest advice is to not worry. Bhagavan will take care of the rest. I used to think “not me.” Scriptures suggest to associate or be in the presence of other devotees. Not me, I thought. I’m not Indian and there are no devotees near me. Still, I prayed to Krishna that a door might open for me. A year later, I have the wonderful company of other devotees in a weekly satsang, right in my hometown! I used to worry about finding a guru, knowing if they were the right one, being able to follow them given various circumstances. Not me, I said, but I put my faith in Krishna and decided to go to a local gathering where I painted a sign with Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam on it. Someone recognized it and introduced themselves. I told them I was a Hindu and they said, “Oh, did you know I was in India with *Guru,* right? If you have a chair, I can tell you my story…it’ll only take four hours!” I smiled because I knew Krishna had opened a door, and I am fortunate to now have the grace and divine wisdom of my guru. Things will happen in God’s timing…it is all his divine play. 

I wanted to take a moment to thank this sub for guiding a curious Westerner along this path. If it weren’t for you, I would have never read the Gita! 

I initially came across this sub as I was wondering what edition of the Ramayana to read. I first read the Ramayana in college and humbly fell before the lotus feet of Lord Rama. But unfortunately I was under the illusion that a Westerner could not devote themselves to Lord Rama. I was quite sad and years later, I longed to simply read the stories of Ram and be in his presence again. I decided to look up what translation was best and I came across this sub…you dispelled that illusion and Lord Rama lives in me. He is within me and pervades everything I am. 

Per the suggestion of many I read the Gita in addition and, well, my life completely changed from that moment! It was like I always knew these truths, I was merely rediscovering them. Discovering a profound connection to Krishna was something I never expected. He is my ishta devata and my whole life is defined by my devotion to him. My, how has life changed in a year! 

Thanks mods for all the hard work you put into this sub and thanks all for contributing to this subreddit, it is invaluable for so many.

Sorry to ramble, but I am so deeply grateful!

1458,"Since it's Ganesh Chaturthi, I wanted to start reading the ancient scriptures specifically written on him, which scriptures are such? The only one I found was Ganesh Purana which I've decided to start reading but not sure **which version should I get if I want to read the original unaltered unabridged form of Ganesh Purana translated in Hindi?** I checked Gita Press website but they didn't have it, any recommendations?"
1459,"I beg your great patience with my request for information that you will please reas the entire post before replying.

I've decided to give Hinduism another chance, previously i followed a form of Vaishnavism/Krishna worship (please forgive me but it tried hard to put my prior experience with Hinduism in the past and worked hard at trying to forget everything i learned from the 8+ months i was a believer, so I do not remember what form of Vaishnavism i practiced at the end) it wasnt ISKON(i am certain of that) it was some form of monistic Krishna belief.

In any case , this time around i felt like starting over from scratch (which is made easier by the effort i put into forgetting as much as i learned the first time), anyway i think it would help me a great deal to know what form of Hinduism/Sanatana Dharma is oldest or least changed by colonialism etc. over time.  Given i am not a native to Hindustan/India  it would need to be one that accepts adherents from other cultures/ethnicities and for which there is a fairly large amount of info available about it in english.   I know that seems like alot of constraints to put on religious truth. But if i am unable to be a part of the religion based on not being born in the ""right"" culture or ethnicity, or am unable to obtain a depth of knowledge about it, I am unlikely to be successful in learning and practicing my faith.

While I have a preference toward monism I am open to learning whatever eldest form fits the criteria above.   And as to which trimurti God or associated gods/goddesses I am open to.   However I do feel pulled toward Brahma, Shiva\[i fell into saying his name long before i knew it was the name of (a) God\] and I have always seen Ganesha as especially attractive.  Now i did spend a good amount of time believing in Vaishna/Krishna as God, and while i have to admit there is still a lingering connection there, i did reach a point in my studies where i felt that connaction was fairly burnt out just when i was learning the most and had the best chances of practicing my faith in him ""successfully""  however at the very point i felt most close to living how he wanted me to i felt further away from him loving me than ever.

This has also been similar to why i am looking again at Sanatana Dharma.  Just at the point when i was feeling i was living my faith at my peak best i felt so far away from being truly loved by him that i felt like i was being totally rejected by him.  So keeping this in mind.  Please help me know if there is an ancient form of Sanatana Dharma/Hinduism  where i wont feel rejected by God/dess just as I am doing the best I can to live according to the teachings found in their faith.   I know it is alot to ask, but i don't think i can take another rejection  by a deity as the last two times have been harder than i can put into words to express how damaging the experience was.

1461,"शिवलिंग कोई साधारण (मूर्त्ति) नहीं है पूरा विज्ञान है!

शिवलिंग में विराजते हैं तीनों देव:-

सबसे निचला हिस्सा जो नीचे टिका होता है वह ब्रह्म है, दूसरा बीच का हिस्सा वह भगवान विष्णु का प्रतिरूप और तीसरा शीर्ष सबसे ऊपर जिसकी पूजा की जाती है वह देवा दी देव महादेव का प्रतीक है, शिवलिंग के जरिए ही त्रिदेव की आराधना हो जाती है तथा अन्य मान्यताओं के अनुसार, शिवलिंग का निचला नाली नुमा भाग माता पार्वती को समर्पित तथा प्रतीक के रूप में पूजनीय है... अर्थात शिवलिंग के जरिए ही त्रिदेव की आराधना हो जाती है। अन्य मान्यता के अनुसार, शिवलिंग का निचला हिस्सा स्त्री और ऊपरी हिस्सा पुरुष का प्रतीक होता है। अर्थता इसमें शिव और शक्ति, एक साथ में वास करते हैं।

शिवलिंग का अर्थ:-

शास्त्रों के अनुसार 'लिंगम' शब्द 'लिया' और 'गम्य' से मिलकर बना है, जिसका अर्थ 'शुरुआत' व 'अंत' होता है। तमाम हिंदू धर्म के ग्रंथों में इस बात का वर्णन किया गया है कि शिव जी से ही ब्रह्मांड का प्राकट्य हुआ है और एक दिन सब उन्हीं में ही मिल जाएगा।

शिवलिंग में विराजते त्रिदेव:-

हम में लगभग लोग यही जानते हैं कि शिवलिंग में शिव जी का वास है। परंतु क्या आप जानते हैं इसमें तीनों देवताओं का वास है। कहा जाता है शिवलिंग को तीन भागों में बांटा जा सकता है। सबसे निचला हिस्सा जो नीचे टिका होता है, दूसरा बीच का हिस्सा और तीसरा शीर्ष सबसे ऊपर जिसकी पूजा की जाती है।

निचला हिस्सा ब्रह्मा जी (सृष्टि के रचयिता), मध्य भाग विष्णु (सृष्टि के पालनहार) और ऊपरी भाग भगवान शिव (सृष्टि के विनाशक) हैं। अर्थात शिवलिंग के जरिए ही त्रिदेव की आराधना हो जाती है। तो वहीं अन्य मान्यताओं के अनुसार, शिवलिंग का निचला हिस्सा स्त्री और ऊपरी हिस्सा पुरुष का प्रतीक होता है। अर्थता इसमें शिव-शक्ति, एक साथ वास करते हैं।

शिवलिंग की अंडाकार संरचना:-

कहा जाता है शिवलिंग के अंडाकार के पीछे आध्यात्मिक और वैज्ञानिक, दोनों कारण है। अगर आध्यात्मिक दृष्टि से देखा जाए तो शिव ब्रह्मांड के निर्माण की जड़ हैं। अर्थात शिव ही वो बीज हैं, जिससे पूरा संसार उपजा है। इसलिए कहा जाता है यही कारण है कि शिवलिंग का आकार अंडे जैसा है। वहीं अगर वैज्ञानिक दृष्टि से बात करें तो 'बिग बैंग थ्योरी' कहती है कि ब्रह्मांड का निमार्ण अंडे जैसे छोटे कण से हुआ है।

By the likes of what we see around today like climate change, nuclear war threat etc, human civilization probably end this millenia. So shouldn't it be 12k years??"
1464,"Why is the sky blue? No no, I'm not asking 'how' or 'by what means' is the sky blue. I'm asking WHY, which implies the there is purpose behind the blueness of the sky.

What if the sky was purple? Would life be any different? Would blue carry the same attributes within our minds, or would those attributes be given to purple instead?

Better yet. Why does humanity feel the need to demand there to be purpose? Children often ask ""What's the meaning of life""? Because meaning implies purpose, this is synonymous to asking ""Why is life?"" For what purpose does life serve?

I could give you my answers to these questions. But would those answers bring you solace? Almost certainly not. That's why, despite how many various answers have been given to these questions throughout the ages, by various philosophers, gurus, prophets and their like, most people still claim these questions to still be 'unanswered.' Because they are not individual questions meant to have universal answers, but rather they are universal questions individuals are meant to answer for themselves.

And as an individual I feel compelled to answer them. For me the answer to the question ""why was the universe created"" is simple. The universe was created for the exact opposite reason it was not, not created. The universe was not, not created, because it exists. Thus, because it exists, it must have been created. So ""why was the universe created?"" Because it must have been.

A similar answer exists for ""what's the meaning of life?"" or rather, ""Why is life?"" Because life asks why. The rock does not ask ""why is rock?"" Because the rock has no intrinsic purpose. Only life has intrinsic purpose. Thus, only life has the inclination to question purpose. Thus, the purpose of life, is to apply purpose. Or put other words, the meaning of life is to give meaning to life. ""Why is life?"" Because life asks 'why?'

So why do we ask why? Because by our nature we are meaningful. Thus as the embodiment of meaning, we are disturbed by the possibility that something can exist without meaning. Then to sooth our discomfort, we ascribe meaning to the meaningless. And no matter how nonsensical this meaning we ascribe may be, all that matters is that we believe the meaning we ascribe to be meaningful. If we find the meaning meaningful, we find solace.

Why do we ask why? Because there exists that which lacks meaning."

1479,"Let me begin with the viewpoint of Advaita Vedanta. In short, the conclusion of Advaita Vedanta is that we are profoundly mistaken about the nature of our real Self. We are not bits of matter of our body-mind complex. Our real nature is Sat-Chit-Ananda; pure being, pure consciousness, and complete fulfillment. Realizing this is the ultimate solution to all our problems. Advaita Vedanta aims to shift our paradigm to understand ourselves and the universe in this way. The method of Advaita Vedanta is based on reason and our common shared experience of consciousness, where we investigate the subject and object and realize that the subject is consciousness and that the object (anything that is experienced) is not something apart from consciousness as well.  A careful distinction is made between mind and consciousness, noting that the mind appears to consciousness and is therefore an object, while consciousness illuminates all objects. The ultimate goal is to recognize that everything is experienced within consciousness. This includes the distinction between the little that is known and the vast seas of the unknown, which make up the universe that appears to consciousness. 

Why is it so difficult to see something that is so simple and clear that everything is happening in consciousness? One of the fundamental unexamined assumptions that we make is a form of dualism even when we are talking about a monist/non-dual metaphysics. What we consider as physical experiences such as perceptions are actually mental events that appear to your observation in consciousness. Which in turn leads to another mental event of our response to such a perception. We think that the existence of a physical world outside the mind is an empirical observation. However, it is not. The physicality of it is an appearance, it is a cognitive representation on the screen of perception, which is not separate from the mind. It is your account of that experience that leads to the abstraction of the world outside the mind, it is not an empirical observation. This is not to say that the entire universe exists only in the confines of your personal mind.  The world is indeed external from the perspective of the ego and not under its control, but is still mental in the sense that it is a process in consciousness.  This viewpoint has no contradiction with science or the scientific method. The scientific process models and predicts nature's behavior and does not make statements about what nature actually IS. Whenever science tries to predict what nature is, it is merely a convenient fiction. For instance, Newton postulated an invisible force of gravitation that attracts the moon and the earth and keeps it in orbit.  Then Einstein corrected him and postulated an invisible fabric of space-time that bends and twists. Our current theory further corrects this theory because, with Quantum gravity, there is no such thing as fundamental space or time, not something within the fabric of nature itself. So convenient fictions keep changing with time.

There are different levels of concessions to language to define the structure of our metaphysics. Metaphysics by itself has nothing to do with language, but our thoughts do. So when we think about metaphysics, we unavoidably impart on our metaphysics the structure of our language. How far are we willing to concede to linguistic structure? Materialism/Dualism makes a lot of concessions to linguistic structures. In language, we have subject and object; verb and noun; past and future etc. which are filled with seeming dualism that exists experientially but not necessarily metaphysically. If we accept all these structures, then a form of dualism is assumed although not necessarily fundamentally true. What we are looking for is something that exists fundamentally in nature and what is the phenomenon that is caused/explainable in terms of these fundamentals. Dualism can ultimately be explained in terms of fundamental things that are non-dual when all the above concessions are made. However if one is not willing to make such concessions, then one leads back to consciousness. But to explain anything some minimum concessions are to be granted. Non-dualism grants only the linguistic structure of time and of action (verbs and nouns), in order to describe the observable processes that occur in consciousness. For example, Advaita Vedanta says that there is only one noun, consciousness, and everything else, the entire universe(Maya), is the verb that is an appearance in consciousness. The evolution of time corresponds to the creation by the creator/controller Ishvara/God. This is the minimum amount of concession that is made by the non-dualistic philosophies in order to explain to people, because it becomes very difficult to not think/speak in terms of time, actions and subject/object even though ultimately their viewpoint is that only consciousness is the only fundamental existing entity. Nothing ever happened nor will anything ever happen. But this is very difficult to convey to people in analytic terms. This is the reason why all non-dualistic schools make room for a conventional/lower level of truth based on our experiential understanding of things.

There is nothing about physical properties in terms of which we could deduce the qualities of experience in principle. There is nothing about color, mass, shape, etc. in terms of which we can deduce what gives rise to first-hand experience (as the first person). There is no problem in nature, but only arises because of our deluded accounts of nature. Duality/multiplicity/qualities are useful only to describe the experiential world. But do these qualities really exist out there? The answer is negative. For example, numbers quantify distances like 1km and 5km. The qualities exist as mental perceptions only (the experience of traveling 1km and 5km). The numbers only have meaning in the context of things that they describe. The difference between 1km and 5km only has meaning given the experience of traveling. If the numbers exist prior to the things they describe, then the semantic reference that gives the number their meaning disappears. So these numbers have no intrinsic meaning and hence cannot deduce anything from them! We confuse empirical experience with abstraction. For example, we refer to matter to refer to the particular concrete experience of perceiving the things around us. In this usage, the matter is undeniable. Nobody denies perceptual experience. When we use matter in the philosophical sense; matter is that which exists behind and beyond experience and which somehow gives rise to and modulates experience. Matter is purely quantitative and has no intrinsic qualities. This philosophical definition of matter can very much be denied because we can account for nature without this abstraction. Denial of philosophical matter is not the denial of perceptual experience. Consider a fictitious example of teapot orbiting around the orbit of Saturn. Nobody can disprove such a claim, but we do not take such statements seriously because we don't need to. The burden of proof is on those who maintain such a claim to explain why we need to entertain such a claim of proposing more entities in order to make sense of nature or experience. When the materialists/dualists say that there is this fundamental metaphysical category that is totally different and outside the mind and it can be exhaustively explained purely in quantitive terms and has no inherent qualities. If those quantities were descriptions of physical stuff; the physical stuff arises by emergence out of the quantities, we are contradicting ourselves. We start with a territory and describe the territory with a map, and then we say that the map precedes the territory. THe quantities precede the qualities, and the qualities somehow, nobody knows how, emerge out of the quantities. This is equivalent to saying the territory emerges out of the map, which is contradictory because the map only has meaning as a description of preexisting territory. This is the teapot orbiting Saturn. They have to argue why we need the extra hypothesis beyond the empirical given, which is mental stuff; mind and consciousness, which is the only metaphysical given of nature that exists before we even begin theorizing.  The non-dualists do not need to prove that consciousness cannot be an emergent property or that consciousness appears as everything in the universe. If one comes up with a description of nature that does not require to account the step; the teapot orbiting around Saturn, then that's it.

1486,"Scrolling through this sub, I've seen too many people struggling with spirituality. Some are trying to gain a philosophical understanding of the scriptures and yet others are dabbling with spiritual practices which shouldn't have been public in the first place. 

Few appreciate the importance of Kripa in the spiritual path. While indeed the path of spirituality involves tapa (""penance""), a major part of your sadhana is just trying to attain divine grace in some or the other form. Without that spark of divinity no matter how many scriptures you read or how much Japa you perform, attaining moksha (or whatever your personal goal might be) is near impossible. Every seeker is ultimately yearning for that one moment of bliss, where the veil completely drops and you merge into the supreme reality. 

Don't make spirituality into a dry task, you must perform every day. Rather immerse yourself in the journey, find joy in your japa, and find moments of astonishing wonderment in your readings. But ultimately take shelter only in Bhagwaan, for only he can help you attain. The oft-quoted verse BG18.66 points us in this direction. By abandoning everything else, simply by Kripa alone the divine is attained.

Now, I am scared that is something bad going to happen to me or my family? Or have I done something wrong? Or is it a bad omen? Kisine kuch kaala jaadu kiya hai because there are many relative who hate us, don't talk to us because we are successful. Please if you all know something, please do tell me. Idk what to do. Fornunately, Ganpati Bappa had zero damage, everything else was fine. Please do let me know🙏"

1500," Think of karma as a deposit in a bank account. Sukha and Dukha are the penalties and the dividends that you pay or are paid.

Whatever you have done this far an all the infinite number of lifetimes is kept in an account against your name as Sanchit Karma. This is the sum total of all the deposit in your account. It has legal, illegal - all sort of investments kept in your account.

When you are born, a summary of your account or your account stament is taken. This decides what you will experience in this life. This is the prarabdha. Whatever you experience in this life will be determined by your prarabdha - think of these as annuities paid out to you when your good karmas from past life (or legal investments) mature, and penalties charged of you (dukha) when illegal investments are uncovered.

Whatever you do in this life is your kriyamana karma and will be added to your Sanchit karma.

Every time you attach yourself with sukh, you exhaust your good karma.

Every time you accept the hardships, you burn your bad karma.

Some people, who are walking on the path of spirituality, are given an accelerated karma-burning amnesty, like the government gives to some people - pay 50% of your property tax and settle your account! This way, some people suffer a reduced hardship for accumulated bad karma in this life. To an outside person, it looks like ""Oho, how much he has to suffer - such a pious man!"" but actually he is feeling blessed that his accumulated karmas are getting disposed on in an accelerated manner!

Someone who is mean and not a good man enjoying a good life is again is previous investment paying dividends! Once the account of goof karma is empty and his current bad karmas add up, he will fall splendidly - see what happened to the likes of Ravana, Kamsa, even Osama bin Laden!

The best is to suffer the hardships you get with humility, stay unattached to pain and joy, and not knowingly do any bad karma."

Before I get into the title in details I just want to say that I was born a Hindu however it is only this year that I have truly truly started practicing the religion. 

I went to the Shiv temple this evening and I reached their around 6-6:15. Usually the evening aarti is held around that time. And as I belong from the Assamese community we use our traditional instruments to offer our prayers. There was the the bortaal (big metallic cymbals that are usually made of bell metal), the temple bells, the doba (big drums) and as the priests started ringing these bells and drums something took over me. I tried not to cry but couldn't help but shed tears as I prayed to lord shiva. All I can recollect from the moment is telling him how thankful I am for his presence in my life. 

&#x200B;

I have been through a lot over the years and being close to god has been the most rewarding experience. As if everything that happened to me happened so I could get closer to him. 

&#x200B;

Is this a normal reaction? 

I have been to many evening aartis before but there was something so profound and pure about today that I smiled all the way back home like a fool. I'm thankful for his presence. He has shown me the way to righteousness, taught me kindness and blessed me with strength.

1525,"I had seen the Star gold Mahabharata, and also read some version here and there. My Question is, after when Duryodhana Tried to take krishna in jail. Shree Krishna got angry on him, and kind of showed the whole sabha one portion of his true form(forgot the name, sorry for that).  most of the sabha got unconscious after looking at it, only few awake.   
Even greatest of greatest villians drop their plan once they know they are absolutely fucked, or even try to harm as much as possible before their inevitable death. Then why someone like Duryodhana, who had some sense, didnt surrender then and there, or at least tried to drop the war idea afterwards?  


Some people say how his arrogance and jealousy kept him blind whole time, resulting all of this. But still, how blind or ignorant one can get, once they God in a form, their brain cant even comprehend what they looking at? He thought he had advantage over Shree Krishna, whose form in that sabha was brighter than thousands of SUN? Someone with knowledge on this, please explain this?

1535,"the way i can communicate this is like so: while there is truly stupid in my experience i need to protect myself with the smart. i have been very hurt by something spiritually, over and over again until i started really saying stop, and i looked to something else besides them for protection. finding that protection, i learned that a lot of what they had to say was a lie. things like “some beings arent deserving of love sometimes” or that i am ever not deserving of love, or that i would suffer the Christian idea of ceasing to exist after i die if i didnt accept jesus and the bible. those things might be the divine in a way, but they arent that divine. they arent what id ask for protection from, and tell me something different than what that divine tells me. i guess it is the difference between that which is truly enlightened and that which isnt. i like referring to the former with a name/word that i do not extend to the latter, so i can have that be my teacher and guide instead.  
can anyone help me understand this? how can all exactly be the divine if some are enlightened and some arent? isnt there a difference between the two? i would like to understand that difference while still knowing that all is the divine, so i dont let things like that hurt me anymore. surely i shouldn't ask a demon for protection and guidance but should ask something fully enlightened instead, even if both might be the divine.  
  
its all so confusing sometimes but i know i am headed in the right direction, i just feel a bit overwhelmed sometimes and need to ask for help."

1553,"Hi everyone, I am reading from Section 2.2, Chpater 25 “Separation of Sati and Shiva” from this version of the Shiva Purana: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/shiva-purana-english](https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/shiva-purana-english)

I’m confused about the meaning of this leela! Shiva and Sati have a fight, causing Shiva to leave Sati, but ultimately forgiving her after some time apart. The chapter ends with the confirmation that Shiva and Shakti are always one and can never be separated.

From what I understand, Sati challenges the divinity of Vishnu (Rama, in this instance) by disguising herself as his missing wife, Sita. When Rama proved his divinity, Sati felt ashamed of herself. She was nervous about confessing this to Shiva:

* *41. Remembering her own action she was much distressed. She returned to Śiva, pale in face and gloomy in spirit.*
* *42. While returning, the Goddess frequently mused—“I did not accept Śiva’s explanation. I entertained a senseless thought against Rāma.*
* *43. After going to Śiva what reply shall I give?” Thinking thus, she began to repent in many ways.*
* *44. Approaching Śiva she mentally bowed to Him, with a pallid face and stricken with grief.*
* *45. On seeing her distressed, Śiva enquired of her health and asked—“O, have you finished your test”?*
* *46. On hearing Śiva’s words she bent her head as a mark of respect but did not say anything. Agitated with grief she stood aghast.*

&#x200B;

Shiva meditates and sees what Sati did:

*47. On meditating for a while, Śiva, the great Yogin, adept in diverse divine sports, could understand everything about Śatī, the daughter of Dakṣa.*

&#x200B;

Shiva thinks to himself that he needs to separate himself from Sati:

* *50. “If I were to maintain my love towards Satī at the level as before, my promise will be broken—even if I follow the conventions of the world”.*
* *Brahmā said:—*
* *51. Thus pondering within himself in diverse ways He mentally discarded Satī but did not break his promise as the protector of Vedic Virtue.*
* *52. Then after forsaking Satī mentally, the lord returned to His abode. He did not at all reveal the promise.'*

&#x200B;

After a while, Shiva forgives her and tells her funny stories to make her feel better:

* *64. The Goddess bowed to Him with a moaning heart. The benevolent Śiva offered her a seat in front of Himself.*
* *65. He narrated several interesting tales to her. By these divine sports He tried to entertain her and make her mind free from grief.*
* *66. She regained her previous happiness.*

&#x200B;

The chapter ends with the explanation that Shiva and Sati can never really be apart from each other:

* *67. But O sage, some ignorant Pandits thus narrate the story of Śivā and Śiva and their separation. But how can there be a real separation between the two?*
* *68. Who knows the true life and conduct of Śivā and Śiva. They sport about of their own accord and make their own lives for ever.*
* *69. Śatī and Śiva are united together like words and their meanings\[3\]. Only if they wish, can their separation be even imagined.*

&#x200B;

So, I understand that last portion; Shiva and Shakti are always one. However, I think I need clarification about how the leela teaches this message. 

After reflecting on the story, I came to this conclusion: Sati and Shiva get into a rough spot in their relationship that causes with Shiva to ignore her. Sati spends a lot of time crying about this. Shiva seemingly has a change of heart and the couple make up with each other. This shows that even during an argument, they will mend things because they can never be apart forever. It’s not possible for the two to stay angry at each other.

Furthermore, the story emphasizes that it is foolish to assume that Shiva is superior to Vishnu. Sati questioned the equality of Vishnu and Shiva, which caused her to become separated her from her husband. 

I don’t know if I am interpreting this story right, or if I am missing something. Why did Shiva feel like he had to abandon his wife? And what made him decide to forgive her? 

I was wondering if any of you could help me understand this better! I am in rural USA without a teacher to give guidance. 

Thanks!"

1557,"https://reddit.com/r/hinduism/s/LGWdCSy8Jc

If all we want and need is to be awakened from this world and if it is much easier to achieve that in Kali than in Satya yuga then shouldn't we all want to live in as dark age as possible, the lowest point of Kali? Why even bring the Golden age back at all it that makes it harder for people to awaken? 

Moreover, if we are collecting good karma points to solicit a more favorable birth next time around and that ends up degrading us because living in us Golden age is so nice we forget about awakening what is the point of good karma then?

1560,So I recently came to an understanding that different sampradayas have different beliefs but what I don't understand is how is one supposed to chose what path is right for him? There are so many saints following different paths giving different conclusions even after being god/Brahman realised. Example: Sir Aurobindo and Shri Kripalu Maharaj both being devotees of lord Krishna are considered to be saints of high caliber. But one viewed Krishna as bramhan and the other viewed him as a god from Goloka. Sir Aurobindo considered this functional force of the universe to be the divine dance of Krishna while Kripalu ji considered the divine dance to be the literal act of dance with his gopis by god.I understand that sadhaks from Bhakti tradition view their god rather personally but me being a devotee of lord Krishna/Vishnu am really confused on how to approach my practice and what sort of guru to find for the same. I am curious to know if Goloka/Vaikuntha is real and if it is then how is it that despite being God's abode it is filled with Maya and pleasures as mentioned in the sashtras.Any insight would be helpful.
1561,"Guru Nanak is not just the first Guru in Sikh religions, but also a Guru for Nanak panthis which interestingly to this day still includes both Muslims in Pakistan and Hindus in India. And many Hindus, especially Punjabis, revere him as Guru Nanak Dev Ji and take inspiration from his poems.

However, he was actually a somewhat controversial figure even in his own time as he debated the Nath Yogis (“Siddh Gosht”) and made criticisms of Jainism. 

His poetry includes critiques of Brahmins as well, but many say these are not criticisms of Brahmanism, but rather of specific Brahmins who were not fulfilling their spiritual duties (and yet were carrying on with rituals). 

So, despite seeming like a universal figure of love, his complex poetry actually seems very open to interpretation.

1571,"I was watching some YouTube videos a few days ago, and curiously enough I have seen a couple videos of some Shaktas, usually ladies, who go into a trance (I suppose they end up embodying the spirit of Kali?), and then while dancing, they will kill chickens by biting their necks until they die. Or they will drink and bathe in goats blood. Basically anything with blood and an animal sacrifice.

How legitimate is this practice to Shaktism? I actually am okay with chicken sacrifices like this; as much as I feel bad for the chickens, this is much better than the factory farm chicken killing in the West. I thought more along the lines of sanitation of raw blood consumption...

But I assumed that proper animal sacrifice would include jhatka, rather than biting chicken necks. Is this a tribal or village form of Shakta Dharma? How acceptable is this to you?"
1572,What are your opinions on Swami Mukundananda? Do you think he is a genuine guru or just another fake god man? I've been to a Pravachanam of his and he seemed pretty genuine but it it seems pretty weird. I can't quite explain it but I felt like something was off

1577,"BG 2.11: The Supreme Lord said: While you speak words of wisdom, you are mourning for that which is not worthy of grief. The wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.

BG 2.19: ""Neither of them is in knowledge—the one who thinks the soul can slay and the one who thinks the soul can be slain. For truly, the soul neither kills nor can it be killed.""

The illusion of death is created because we identify ourselves with the body. The Ramayan explains this as follows:

jauṅ sapaneṅ sira kāṭai koī, binu jāgeṅ na dūri dukh hoī. [v23]

“If we dream of our head getting cut, we will perceive its pain until we wake up.”

Gita 2.20, Krishna explains to Arjuna, ""For the soul, there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.""

BG 2.21: O Parth, how can one who knows the soul to be imperishable, eternal, unborn, and immutable kill anyone or cause anyone to kill?

Gita 2.27, Krishna states, ""Death is certain for one who has been born, and rebirth is inevitable for one who has died. Therefore, you should not lament over the inevitable.""

BG 2.28: O scion of Bharat, all created beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest in life, and again unmanifest on death. So why grieve?

BG 2.30: O Arjun, the soul that dwells within the body is immortal; therefore, you should not mourn for anyone.

Gita 2.47, Therefore, do not grieve for those who have attained a higher state after death. Instead, focus on your duties and work towards self-realization. Understand that the soul is eternal and strive to perform your actions without attachment, surrendering the results to Me 

Chapter 3, Verse 13: ""The spiritually-minded, who eat food that is first offered in sacrifice, are released from all kinds of sin. Others, who cook food for their own enjoyment, verily eat only sin""

Gita 3.27, Krishna explains, ""All activities are carried out by the three modes of material nature. But in ignorance, the soul, deluded by false identification with the body, thinks of itself as the doer.""

Gita 3.31, Those who abide by these teachings of Mine, with profound faith and free from envy, are released from the bondage of karma.

Bhagavad Gita 3.33, Even wise people act according to their natures, for all living beings are propelled by their natural tendencies. What will one gain by repression?

Chapter 4, Verse 14, ""There is no work that affects Me; nor do I aspire for fruits of action. One who understands this truth about Me also does not become entangled in the fruitive reactions of work."" True freedom lies in realizing that the soul is eternally pure and untouched by the consequences of actions.

Chapter 4, Verse 29: ""Those who see the same Supreme Lord dwelling in all beings, they do not slay, nor cause to be slain.""

BG 5.8-9: Those steadfast in karm yog, always think, “I am not the doer,” even while engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, excreting, grasping, and opening or closing the eyes. With the light of divine knowledge, they see that it is only the material senses that are moving amongst their objects.

Gita 9.28, By dedicating all your works to Me, you will be freed from the bondage of good and bad results. With your mind attached to Me through renunciation, you will be liberated and will reach Me.

BG 9.30: Even if the vilest sinners worship Me with exclusive devotion, they are to be considered righteous because they have made the proper resolve.

BG 11.33: Therefore, arise and attain honor! Conquer your foes and enjoy prosperous rulership. These warriors stand 'already slain by Me', and 'you will only be an instrument' of My work, O expert archer

BG 11.34: Dronacharya, Bheeshma, Jayadratha, Karn, and other brave warriors have already been 'killed by Me'. Therefore, slay them without being disturbed. Just fight and you will be victorious over your enemies in battle.

Chapter 17, Verse 10: ""Foods that increase life, purify one’s existence, give strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction, which are juicy, fatty, wholesome, and pleasing to the heart, are dear to those in the mode of goodness.""

BG 18.14: The body, the doer (soul), the various senses, the many kinds of efforts, and Divine Providence—these are the five factors of action.

BG 18.15-16: These five are the contributory factors for whatever action is performed, whether proper or improper, with body, speech, or mind. Those who do not understand this regard the soul as the only doer. With their impure intellects they cannot see things as they are.

BG 18.17: Those who are free from the ego of being the doer, and whose intellect is unattached, though they may slay living beings, they neither kill nor are they bound by actions.

BG 18.18: Knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower—these are the three factors that induce action. The instrument of action, the act itself, and the doer—these are the three constituents of action.

Gita 18.66, ""Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear."""
1578,Can we workship stone idol at home
1579,A few years ago while visiting Rishikesh a sadhu gifted me a rudraksha bead. My memory is quite vague and I’m not sure if it was given to me as I had given him some money or not. Is there any specific meaning or way to interpret this act? There seems to be certain spiritual ”rules” regarding Rudraksha beads that I’m not knowledgeable about. How could this act be interpreted?
1581,"If it's someone's first life and he dies as soon as he is born is it KARMA or a TRAGEDY ??

Do we even face the consequences of KARMA in real world?? and if we do is it in present life or after life or both??

When KRISHNA died by arrow in his foot, what was it a CURSE or KARMA of his past life??

How KARMA even works in the case of GOD, do they also go to HELL or HEAVEN for their actions?? Or instead of HELL they come to REAL WORLD to bear their consequences??

Does KARMA even effect the real world?? OR it's only for the after world and only determines where you will go in afterlife?? HELL or HEAVEN?

So, Someone with net positive karma goes to Heaven and someone with net negative karma goes to Hell.

But suppose if someone murders someone for his gain but later realizes his deed and attains a total of net positive karma, will he still go to HEAVEN??
Despite him doing a murder?? Does 10 RIGHTS make 1 WRONG, RIGHT too??

Or instead of net positive or net negative it work like this, first you go to HELL for your bad deeds,(your deeds determine it's severity and duration) and ones you exhaust your negative Karma, then you go to HEAVEN for your Good deeds (good deeds determining your time) until you exhaust your positive KARMA.

Hence, becoming neutral and Your Birth in the real world is totally Random until you finally attain MOKSH, meaning KARMA only applies to after life and there's no divine intervention by GOD, because to intervene even GOD has to take human form and follow the rules of real world, and basically becoming human?? 

Because to me if someone dies and then you blame it on his karma, feels pretty bad, and Instead of KARMA you face the consequences of real world and rules of the society your born into, there is no KARMA in real world??

What makes the most sense to you??"
1582,Is it written in any of our scriptures to not cut hair/nail on these days? I don't understand the logic behind this. Or is it just a myth?
1583,Why in some texts she is said to be wife of varun (who is sometimes mentioned as dev & sometimes asur) & in others as his daughter as she emerged from the cosmic ocean before/after lakshmi devi? Is she most active in kaliyug as she is maya devi & who everyone calls as alakshmi? Why is she with kalipurush if her husband is varun or are they same? In zoroastrian religion varun dev is ahura mazda (highest god) can anybody project their opinions based on history that what might have caused this eternal rift in families initially? Also does varuni or jyestha have powers of triple goddesses herself? In some texts varuni & jyestha’s story mentioned them being combined form of trinity.
1584,"The jiva comes out with the letter Ha and gets in again with the letter Sa. Thus jiva always utters the mantra 'Ham-sa,' 'Hamsa'. The jiva always utters the mantra twenty-one thousand and six hundred times in one day and night. This is called Ajapa Gayatri and is ever the bestower of nirvana to the yogins. Through its very thought, man is freed from sins. Neither in the past nor in the future is there a science equal to this, a japa equal to this or a meritorious action equal to this."
1585,"I was wondering if anyone could find a book or idol or anything like that about ganesh that goes before 1st century CE  
I know ganesh is mentioned in 

taittariya aranyaka 10.1.5 and in maithrayaniya samhita 2.9.1 of krishna yajur veda   
and is the author of mahabharatha  
but apparently these verses are interpolations and added in a later date going past the date the vedas were made and regarding mahabharatha apparently that only 37 manuscripts mentioned ganesh writing it  
would be appreciated if anyone could find anything about ganesh before the first century or if they could a find a sholk about him in valmiki ramayan"

1590,"We all know that in order to realize the highest truth unbound by space and time, the cause of reality and reality itself. We must recess into the deepest layers of our being. However, it is no secret that the lives of laypeople are shrouded in constant maya and distraction, virtually making reaching samadhi/freedom as a layperson almost impossible. I generally hold a very high disregard for bhakti as I am not a very devotional person. Let’s all be honest, no layperson participates in jnana (unless you have a personal guru). I do see karma yog as a very viable path, but I seek deep inner realizations that can only be accessed by well… meditation. I’d figure that this community would have one of the best answer to this question. (Criticism is very encouraged)"
1591,hi guys. i know this might be a stupid question but how does one eliminate the fear of death? not the fear of me dying but the fear of my loved ones passing. it has gotten so bad to the point where i avoid my loved ones in order to find a way to no longer love them so i dont have to go through the pain of watching them pass away. im just 18 i know but trivial stuff like that hinders my devotion to god. is there a verse in any of our holy scriptures that could help me get a better understanding of this?

1594,"Hello, title

First, I come from Abrahamic religions. For them, animals have no soul and it's silly to grieve for a dog.    
Now I wamt to emphasize that I miss that dog, not a dog. I miss her personality, how she behaved. There are scientific studies showing losing a close pet hurts the brain/mind like losing a loved one.    

I was wondering, how do you see this situation? Is it ok to grief, is it ok to decorate where she is burried? She will be entering a new circle of existence, right? 

What god can help? I really love Ganesha, He helped me a lot. 

I feel a bit uneasy with this question because it sounds like ""westerner looking for new age stuff"". But no one knows here I pray to Ganesha. 
 
Anyway I will appreciate your input. Where I live there is no center for Dharma so I have no one to ask.

Thanks"

1600,"We all know that shabar mantras are mantras which are in a language other than sanskrit. They are extremely potent because they do not need to be 'unlocked' like sanskrit mantras. Besides being a believer of sanathan dharma, I'm also an occultist who has been practicing other spiritual and esoteric paths. So what I've found is that there are incantations in certain practices which yield instant to fast results. They are usually in Latin, Greek, Hebrew etc. There are also some chants in other religions which work immediately. Can these incantations and chants be considered as shabar mantras? Do they work on the same principle as shabar mantras?"

1) What does hinduism say about criticism and questioning things as longs as it's done respectfully? Is it allowed ?

2) How can I as a hindu stay strong amidst hinduphobia and people who are ignorant about it ? I feel extremely insecure about it. The ignorance in Kali Yuga is truly astounding to see 

3) If i want to attain moksha with the intention of having a definite goal in my mind.. and not because i truly want it, will I still attain it ? I feel like right now it's very fear and compulsion based.. I want to change that.

4) Is it normal to cry during bhakti ? 

5) Is there written definite proof that santana Dharma is eternal ?

Right after that swarm of Sikh or punjabi users started saying lurid and misogynistic comments about Hindu Gods/Goddesses and Hindu people. 
This is not for the first time though but never saw such vengeful attitude from a religious group which included a myriad of Hindu/Sanatan Bhakti ethos into them. 

What could be the reason? 
Due to political fractures in India?
If so then this is alarming that few Khalistanis managed to poison the whole well of Sikhism.

Are you a convert to Hinduism or a ""cradle"" believer?

Are you a Vaishnavi, Shaivite, other?

It can be a touchy subject but eithout mentioning the terrible abuses or supposed mistranslations what is the main reason you dislike ISKCON? Do you feel they are too restrictive?
How does ISKCON compare to other organizations/teachers like Srila Narayana Maharaja, Sri Sri Vinod Bihari Das Baba ji, and others? 

No malice is intended in this post as I'm new and American and in American ISKCON is most prevalent and I find the most inspiration from it I suppose because of this but I also see a lot of people denegrading ISKCON and Srila Prabupadha.

1630,"In the Gita, Krishna announced that he is the Supreme being.

By applying this Krishna perspective to everyone, in my opinion, Heaven comes to Earth. Why ? Because humility is an exalted state not a lowly one.  Humility is properly understood when you can see the Divine in each individual you meet.

Furthermore, when you recognize that the Supreme that lives in you, is the real you, then you also realize that you live in the hearts of everyone else too.

Here becomes the paradox, because what defines humility can be seen as delusions of grandeur or megalomania.  And yet, this is the true meaning of Namaste. The most humble person is humble because of this exalted Selfishness."

1633,"I’ve had a daily mindfulness meditation and yoga practice for 10 years and have read many Buddhist books. I’m super interested in Eastern philosophy and religion and I’ve been backpacking Southeast Asia the last few months, doing yoga retreats, and several day meditation retreats.

My plan is to go to India and do a ten day Vipassana at Tushita in Dharamshala.  I also am thinking to stay in an ashram in Rishikesh, but I’m not sure if those yoga classes will just be asanas or if I will learn more from them too.  
The last yoga retreat I went on had a “yoga philosophy” class every day where we learned a ton about Jnana (rather than just asanas, which is what most western yoga classes focus on). This was my favorite part of the retreat. 

I really want to learn more, not just via practice, but almost by daily lecture, about Buddhism, Hinduism, actual yoga. Does anyone know about something like this in India? Or anywhere else for that matter?"

Fully giving up attachment to fruit, desire, not being judgemental to anyone, engaging in bhakti(im assuming puja and hawan and all that), the emphasis of varna system (probably the thing i disagree with MOST) just dont make sense to me. I feel like its pretty impossible for a human to do that considering the kinda world we live in. I mean, give up desire? Is that even possible lol. Maybe the summary just isn't fully accurate of whats in Gita but idk. Can I just read it for now without fully believing in it? It feels very peaceful and calming to me and I love the feeling <3"

The story goes that Shiva asks Devi, about a method to fulfill all desires in Kali Yuga. Devi then reveals this stotra out of her love for Shiva (and compassion for her devotees). Chanting this every day would be an amazing step for a beginner. Not only would this help them develop their spiritual practice but also help them gain some insight into Shakta Philosophy.

When we say the name of the metre (**anuṣṭup chandaḥ**), we must touch our nose. When we say the name of the deity of the stotra (**śrī mahākālī mahālakṣmī mahāsarasvatyō dēvatāḥ**) we must touch the point where the center of our chest (the point where your ribcage meets your stomach), since that is the location of Anahata Chakra (the spiritual heart). When we say the name of the deity for whose grace we are chanting (**śrī durgā prītyarthaṁ**), we must do the pranam mudra (famously the namaste gesture) near the Anahata and slowly flip them outwards, bringing them back to the pranam mudra.

I’ve been heavily interested in Hinduism for a while now and I’ve determined that I want to start practicing. However, I am having so much trouble trying to decide which God or Goddess is the one for me. With so many, how do I choose? Sometimes I feel a connection with Lord Shiva, and other times it may be Vishnu or Krishna. Does anyone have any tips? Thank you so much in advance."

1644,"Hare Krishna, When I was 14 ,one day my father and Mama were talking about Krishna.

They said Baal Krishna was from the Ultimate region of our existence, the Bhrama !  The interesting part to me was when they said that after his Bal Roop was ended, that Ultimate tatva left his body. Then whoever was left was Vishnu avatar Krishna. Later he was denied entry in Radha's village with Radha saying -"" You are not my Krishna, I don't know you and if you try to enter my place, you will catch fire ""

Another interesting thing they discussed was that people only pray the Baal roop of Shree Krishna with Radha or Baal Krishna alone. What is the truth ? Did Baal roop of Shree Krishna really was the Ultimate tatva himself who left after Kans Vadh I suppose ? Why did Radha denied Krishna later and refused to acknowledge him as her Krishna ?"

My mind has become a Khichdi of all wisdom I listened these past 5-6 years. 400+ being very generous it is easlily 600+ as I listen daily to someone be it Osho be it Acharya Prashant.

So we don't influence the world, we just inherit it and then have to play as best we can with the cards we are dealt. For our own sakes, and not changing of the world. The world and its particular time is a state, and it is as it is, where we are simply visitors. Best we can do it achieve illumination here and try help as many others."

Namaste to the people of this sub,

Any leads or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!"
1653,"Namaste!

As the title says I am new to Hinduism. I have read some Upanishads, some of the Bhagavad Gita, a little bit of the Brahma Sutras, and finally a little of the yoga sutras. 

So here’s what happened. I kept reading to meditate on Brahman so I did. I came outside and lit up a little camp fire and began my meditation.

Here’s what I ended up writing down after and what I learned. I am so happy to share this. Keep in mind this is what I have learned for myself and see as a truth.

Brahman is like fire.

Brahman is like an everlasting flame on a torch. Atman is like another torch being lit by Brahman during its creation. 

As the fire of Atman is the same flame as Brahman, Atman also burns forever.

A fire you create needs 3 things to become and be. Fuel, air, and spark.

The food this body eats is fuel, the air this body breathes is air, the spark is the eternal burning flame of Atman.

Everything is a manifestation of Brahman. 
It is Brahman that created me, transforms me, and sustains me.

All I have to do is maintain my awareness, focus, and will towards Brahman.

Brahman, like fire, burns away the flesh. Eventually leading to the loss of sensation. Free from the flesh and sensation, Atman no longer experience pain or the suffering of life. Leading to only experience itself. The sacred flame of Brahman.

Brahman the eternal flame, all things return to it as fuel, prana or air, and the flame of Brahman itself as the spark, the fire burns forever and ever.

Throw wood into a fire and it turns into ash and smoke. Blow air into it and it burns hotter. Put an already burning stick into it and it becomes the same fire.

I look forward to learning so much more and seeing Brahman in everything. Thank you so much for reading. I can’t wait for comments and more perspectives.

Aum. 

So I guess my main question is this. How did you discover Brahman? How did you see Brahman for the first time?"
1655,"Do I plan to do anushthan of yhe mantra om namah shivaya, at the end we have to do dashansh havan. Some say you shouldn't say swaha at the end of om namah shivaya mantra. Now dashansh home is done of the mantra that you did anushthan of. Some say instead of om namah shivay swaha I should say om shivay namah swaha, but that changes the mantra. What should I do?"
1656," When Arjuna was in dilemma before the war, Mahabharata started, as he felt its bad karma by killing his own blood related ones in battle. Krishna says dharma of arjuna is to fight war, as the war was inevitable. It was the war to destroy evil and establish dharma for the coming yuga ( age).

 Dharma means “the law”.  Sanatana Dharma is the eternal law, dimension of life which does not change, which is the basis of our existence. The Sanatana Dharma does not belong to you or me ­– it is laid down by creation. It is not even in our hands to dilute it. Individual *understanding* may be diluted. From person to person, there may be different dimensions of understanding. we cannot dilute it, because you did not create it. 

Every religion, spiritual guru or their sayings are passed on to generations not in untouched ways, they are misinterpreted and misunderstood. 

Wherever you are, whether you are Indian, Hindu, non-Hindu, whatever you are, Sanatana Dharma applies to everyone"
1658,Nowadays many people have opened this morcha like some Christains stating the end is near and citing Bhavishya Malika.

Namaste to all. My mom's family is going on the Chardham Yatra in about two weeks. They have a very ancient tradition. Every year, for Pitru Paksha, they will go to one important temple that is located near a river. There they will take darshanam of the deity and the next day they will do puja for Pitru Devata and release tarpanam into river. Last year, they went to Kashi. This year, they are going on the Chardham Yatra. Ove only ever heard of a few things about it. I know that it includes Bhadri, Puri and two others that I don't know. Can anyone please enlighten me about the Yatra and the temples? Also, what is something that can be bought there? They plan on sending us gifts for Dusserah but don't know what to get. Is there anything important or religious things that they can buy and send us? Specifically something that doesn't spoil up to a week(we don't live in India so they will have to parcel it to us). Thank you. Jai Shree Ram"
1661,"Hello all,

I was recently introduced to the world of Indian philosophy and the prominent figures. I am intrigued especially by the philosophy of Adi Shankaracharya and was wondering if anyone of you has any book suggestions that highlights this part of Indian philosophy? 

Sorry if this is not directly relevant to this sub, I am also happy to remove this post if not relevant :)"
1662,"So I wanted to see if everyone could provide their personal experiences with mediation and provide any advice for beginners. 

If possible, can we please avoid discussion of Gurus, we all know theres no consensus on this and chanting. Please keep it to personal experiences and any advice you can offer to newbies. 

My own advice is simple. Take it slow, don't get frustrated at yourself and ensure you are in a calm mental place before you begin. It's also okay if your chanting is a bit 'wobbly' to start with and if it feels like you can't get the rhythm. These things will come with time and you shouldn't feel bad about it, especially if you are like me and still learning Sanskrit. 

Today I had to remind myself of these things because my chanting was wobbly and I could feel myself falling into frustration because my work wasn't perfect. I had to remember that with Bhakti, my work isn't for me to reap the rewards but Lord Vishnu himself. Once I remembered this, and I restored my thoughts to doing it for Him, I felt a wave of calmness wash over me and my chanting sorted itself out."

I looked up embodiment dance and I found out that what I have been doing was “shamanic healing kundalini dance” I try to avoid everything kundalini bc I have heard terrifying things about it and have had psychosis in the past.

Anyway, I know tantra is never a good idea to do without being initiated and I wasn’t intitated. I only did the dance twice for 10 minutes… so for 20 minutes total. Am I just over thinking this? I’m just worried bc I definitely do feel pretty weird after doing it… I’m never doing it again"

The water changed color, but the beads still have the color. Do you guys think their real?"
1675,"Mahabhartham has been a touching epic that my mom used to say when I was a kid and I naturally grow interested in it. I think, most of people like me like to think that nature has balance in everything and that the Kauravas didn’t get away with their misdeeds. But things in real life doesn‘t happen that way. 

Today I read that my country India or Bharatha Varsha used to be a very developed nation having nearly 30% of world‘s gpd. It was so rich in education literature, textiles, jewellery and so on. All of a sudden some people from somewhere came in and tactically and deliberately destroyed everything from Kohinoor to people‘s lives. 

The riches of my mother country were taken from her for their enjoyment while people here were literally starved to death. Education literacy, scriptures were burned to ashes destroying so much history of this country. Some economist even said it’s the worst loot of human history. 

I know I’m angry on something that happened before I was even born but this boils my blood because people comment that we don’t have toilets and even so many horrible things. Today people are slowly and painstakingly developing the country and the states are reviving their cultures. 

But that’s completely unfair. How does this unfairness be explained by god? Or even our puranas? "

1678,"My mother passed away last year, and I went through the 13 days of rituals along with my family. My relatives are a selfish and toxic bunch of people. They are very ""God-fearing"" and sanctimonious on the outside but couldn't care less on the inside. They enforced all the rituals by the book. 

I was not in a state of mind to entertain these people, and I honestly did not care if I completed some ritual on some specific day. During that time, all I kept thinking was that I wanted to be left alone with my grief and to cry in peace, and I especially hated seeing my relatives every day because they were vultures. But I did those rituals anyway because I was not in a state of mind of rebellion. Just went with the flow.

So, my question is, is it so bad not to do these 13 days of rituals? Is it sinful? I believe all these customs/rituals/traditions, etc, are man-made. God didn't make them. For example, God doesn't care if I bought a new toothbrush on the 5th day post-death (because you are not allowed to buy new things). I should be able to do so without judgment. 

I read our scriptures, but I follow only Gita as my rule book. I believe that God judges us by the kind of person we are and how we behave with other people, animals, and nature.

Please enlighten me."

1697,"In a recently published article in 'The Print', Acharya Prashant explains the true meaning of 'Sanatan Dharma' in the light of the recent controversy."
1698," The topic of the intersection between Kundalini Shakti and non-duality comes up on this sub from time to time. Many passages have been quoted from scripture and some have shared their personal experiences. Scripture is always useful, it gives one’s thoughts a grounding and a language to employ when describing experiences and concepts. However, anyone can just go ahead and read what sages have written on the topic a long time ago, this is often coded in language that is antiquated and no longer easily accessible to the modern reader, often replete with symbolism and complicated Sanskrit terms. Some, like the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad, recommend techniques that are dangerous and unnecessary.

&#x200B;

Kundalini has often been associated with cults as many unscrupulous actors have misused their powers to ensnare and manipulate people, therefore Kundalini often gets a bad rap these days. It has also been watered down and misappropriated in New Age circles, whilst on the other hand, many undergoing various forms of mental illness, cling to the idea that they are undergoing a spiritual or Kundalini awakening, probably as a coping mechanism, or some sort of desperate attempt to avoid facing the true nature of their condition.

&#x200B;

As a consequence, it is difficult to talk about Kundalini in a measured and thoughtful manner and the responses such a discussion is likely to elicit are often unsavoury and unhelpful. Nevertheless, I feel that those of us who have first-hand experience must continue to espouse the truth and discuss this openly and without prejudice. Doing so, generally opens oneself up to various unfounded accusations and attacks. A lot of people get triggered by an honest discussion of the topic for reasons only they can understand. My own feeling is that it reveals deep-seated insecurities and fears within their own psyche. I am always taken aback by the ferocity of the reactions and attacks, whenever the topic is openly discussed, which comes from all sort of quarters, even from those that consider themselves gatekeepers of the Kundalini community. Whilst first I took such attacks personally and tried to find fault within myself, I have since realised, that such people are simply projecting and their real issue is with themselves, I’m merely the mirror that reflects their own flaws back at them. There is no use arguing with such people, often set in their ways, so I have learnt to just ignore and block them. Life is too short and precious to waste it on haters and narcissists.

&#x200B;

So, here I don’t want to go into too much detail as regards my own awakening / rising process, I wrote many posts about it, made videos, was interviewed for podcasts, etc…, so I’d rather talk about the specifics of how I see the relationship between Kundalini and non-duality.

&#x200B;

The basic framework within Hinduism, allowing for some variation between different schools of thought is this:

&#x200B;

In the beginning, there was Brahman.

&#x200B;

Brahman was all there was, the absolute, non-dual, ultimate reality in which all possibility existed simultaneously, including us, Jivas, individual expressions of the absolute, but unmanifest in its potentiality.

&#x200B;

In Brahman, there was infinite Joy, Bliss, Knowledge of Truth and pure consciousness (Satchitananda).

&#x200B;

However, the infinite was desirous of manifesting, individuating and thus separating itself into smaller portions of itself so that each can experience individual existence over an infinitude of lifetimes, learning, growing, evolving and eventually returning home, merging back into source to share its experience with the infinite, that is all. Thus, the infinite gets to experience life from a myriad different perspectives and enrich itself as a result.

&#x200B;

In order to manifest a dualistic universe, one with attributes and characteristics, Brahman had to divide itself. It split a portion of it, that which was intended to manifest a new universe, into two opposing but complementary forces. The male aspect became known as Shiva (God), the female as Shakti (Goddess). Whilst Shiva was the source of Shakti, Shakti was his creative, active power.

&#x200B;

This creative power formed into what is known as Mahamaya, the Holographic structure we call the Universe, the underlying lattice, even power that forms the basis of all there is. In ancient myth, it is often imagined that the gods and goddesses weave the fabric of life, they create time and space and are directly responsible for weaving the fate of mortals, hence ancient religion was mostly about trying to influence or implore the gods to do minor changes to the fabric of existence or fate, on their worshippers’ behalf. Prayer is still mostly intended to achieve that, as do most religious and magical rituals.

&#x200B;

However, in Advaita Vedanta and most other Yogic and Tantric philosophies, this is seen as unimportant and a side-issue or distraction at best. All of the above practitioners assume that their run of individuation has run its course, they’ve learnt all they can and now they are ready to return to source.

&#x200B;

Since the manifest universe was created through the separation of Shiva from Shakti, it is assumed that it can be uncreated, by reuniting the two polarities of God and Goddess once again. This is often coded in symbolic language, with the gist being that Shakti longs to reunite with her lover, Shiva.

&#x200B;

In Yoga, this is conceptualised as follows:

&#x200B;

The human body is like a tree of life, with the root, the Muladhara, located at the base of the spine, which connects to Mother Earth (Originally Prithivi, now Devi, Shakti). The crown, or Sahasrara opens up to Father Sky (originally Dyaus Pitar, now Ishwara, Shiva, etc…). Muladhara is the root of consciousness and the human body grows and is nourished by feminine earth energy through this root, which is why we refer to Earth as Mother. The root sprouts the whole tree and as it grows it generates the entire energy body, with seven main chakras along the spine of the tree, thousands of nadis that circulate prana, a form of subtle energy generated by the digestion of food and absorbed from the air through breathing and a handful of Shakti Nadis located along the spine, which I’ll get to shortly.

&#x200B;

Kundalini is the seed energy, the creative force of God, which enters the female egg to “plant its seed” so to speak. We don’t know the exact procedure, but it is believed that Kundalini is the power that creates life in the fertilized egg, animates dead matter and makes it grow and develop until it becomes a fully-formed human being. It is an aspect of Shakti, localised to a particular part of the body and intended for a particular task.

&#x200B;

Once Kundalini has completed its task, it will lay dormant in a person until the moment of death. However, there are circumstances under which it will reactivate and start an entirely new process of formulation, however this time, it doesn’t physically form a new person, rather it takes an existing person (usually an adult, commonly around age 33, for various complicated reasons to do with numerology and symbolism) and transforms them into a new version of themselves, acting as an evolutionary mechanism, to create a “new man” so to speak, one that appears the same on the surface but has undergone a complete inner transformation and is thus essentially reborn.

&#x200B;

Many traditions describe this inner transformation, which in the end is like a death and rebirth, similar to the profound change most people who have gone through a Near Death Experience (NDE) commonly exhibit. Brahmins are called twice-born for this reason and some Christian denominations baptise people as adults and refer to them being reborn. Some monastic traditions even issue a new, spiritual names to initiates, to honour this fact. Many Swamis get their commonly known names like that.

&#x200B;

However, this is just a very small portion, the initial part of the process. The ultimate goal is union with the divine and for the individual Jiva to return to its infinite form, sharing its individuality and the lessons it has learnt, with the whole of Brahman. In Brahman, all are one, as an essential feature of non-duality, but that doesn’t mean individuals cease to exist, merely that they share their individuality with others, with the whole, becoming part of a greater reality and consciousness.

&#x200B;

Kundalini is the vehicle by which this union, this return to non-duality is most commonly achieved. In symbolic terms, Kundalini Shakti, located in the root, driven by her desire to reunite with her lover, Shiva, who resides in the Crown, starts rising up along the tree of life, cleansing the various impurities along the way, until she reaches Shiva in the Crown, where they reunite and dance an ecstatic bridal dance. Because the sudden release of Bliss that happens when they reunite resembles the ecstasy of an orgasm, this is often depicted symbolically in an erotic fashion. It is an apt metaphor, but often misunderstood by modern audiences, who were socialised on the commodification and cheapening of sexuality.

&#x200B;

When Shiva and Shakti reunite, duality and with it matter, ceases to exist, or in other words, it is destroyed, annihilated, extinguished. Shiva is known as the destroyer for this reason, we talk about matter-antimatter annihilation in physics and extinguishment of the false self and duality in Buddhism. As in a matter-antimatter annihilation, nothing is truly destroyed, matter is simply converted to energy, which is witnessed as a light explosion. There is a release of pure spiritual light, often referred to as the light of Brahman or Satchitananda (truth-consciousness-bliss). Usually, this explosion of light is accompanied by a sensation of liquid light flowing into the brain which is heard as the flowing of a stream, the roaring of a waterfall, or the buzzing of bees, depending on the intensity of the flow. All kinds of other sounds can be heard and there are often pleasing smells and sights that appear in front of the practitioner, along with various religiously inspired visions, or if they are not religiously inclined, they may see the divine as pure white light.

&#x200B;

The rising process itself is generally a lengthy one, taking years or lifetimes even. Many people don’t complete their rising process in this lifetime and will continue in the next one where they had left off. It is a long and arduous process, since it requires profound inner transformation and cleansing. As the serpent power (Kundalini Shakti) rises up along the spine, it touches various energy centres, which in the subtle bodies (astral, emotional, causal, etc…) are where past memories, traumas, karma (the consequential memories of past actions) and samskaras (proclivities, personality imprints) are stored. As the energy touches a particular centre (chakra), which also corresponds to nerve clusters, past memories and traumas resurface and must be dealt with. The practitioner must practice surrender and letting go, trusting the process and the divine intelligence behind it. Since one must face past fears, hangups, unpleasant memories, traumas, as they resurface, this must be practiced with equanimity and detachment. The practitioner is aware that the process is happening, but he’s merely the observer, he is allowing Shakti to work on his subtle bodies, whilst practicing surrender to the divine. He has to come face-to-face with his ugly side, his weaknesses and failings, his shadow self, so to speak.

&#x200B;

By accepting the duality of his own personality, he practices acceptance of all, the good, the bad and the ugly, accepting that a material universe has to be dualistic by definition and both light and shadow must be embraced and integrated in order to progress towards non-duality. Some sects, especially in Tantra and Aghora, take this to extremes, but it is not necessary to go to quite the lengths they do. It is all in the mind after all and once dualities are accepted and integrated (the good with the bad, light with the dark, masculine with feminine, solar with lunar, etc…), further progress can be made. Energetically, this is expressed by how Shakti, as an energy flows in the main Shakti nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna) which are located along the spine. Ida and Pingala are dualistic, whereas Sushumna, the central channel located in the spinal column, unites dualities and leads to balance. Individuals in whom either Ida or Pingala is overactive suffer from various neurological symptoms, such as sensations of extreme heat or cold. Balancing out complementary energies and proclivities is the key here and this required a lengthy process of inner work, inner alchemy, as it is often called. This does not necessarily have to be yogic in nature, there are other methods and traditions that can be employed, too many to count. However, as a rule, we can differentiate between masculine (Shiva), feminine (Shakti) and neutral (non-dual, Brahmanic) energies which interact with each other in the subtle bodies in a complex manner, flowing in the various Shakti nadis.

&#x200B;

There are various types of Kundalini risings, though there are some commonalities. In general, the process is bottom-up, though it may be preceded by a top-down “download” of masculine energy which is rather sudden, usually compared to being struck by lightning. When this happens, the “lightning bolt” travels all the way down the spine and activates Kundalini as it rests in the Muladhara. There are three knots located along the spine which must be traversed for any sort of Kundalini rising to progress and this is often extremely hard, with the second and third one in particular being beyond the capabilities of most modern people. The first one (Brahma Granthi) is located just above the root chakra and acts as a “plug” or stop, to make sure Kundalini stays dormant and doesn’t rise on its own spontaneously, which can wreak havoc on a person’s life. This “plug” can be dislodged accidentally, for instance through blunt force trauma on the coccyx or various other traumas. Sometimes the use of psychedelics may have the same effect and the effects of such and unwanted / unplanned awakening are always unpredictable. This is different from what I would call “natural” or spontaneous Kundalini rising, which happens automatically and naturally in someone who is ready for it and practices the right spiritual disciplines, such as meditation, yoga, prayer, chanting and the studying or hearing of scripture.

&#x200B;

The second “plug” or knot is called Vishnu granthi and is located just above the heart centre, since Vishnu is the deity that rules over the heart, symbolised by a hexagram. This knot is overcome through bhakti yoga, devotion to a deity or Brahman. There is a simply reason for that, since the heart is the centre for love, anyone who shuts out universal, divine love from their heart will suffer greatly when the energy reaches this high. They will need to cultivate Love for God (Brahman or Ishwara) in order to universalise their heart organ. It cannot remain particularised, sequestered and compartmentalised, it cannot harbour hate or separation. This is where universal love and compassion for all must be cultivated, or the practitioner will fail to progress in this lifetime.

&#x200B;

The third and last knot is known as Rudra Granthi and it is located just below the crown. So-called because Rudra is another name for Shiva and he resides in the space above the crown, which is infinite, but opens up from the top of the head. When this Granthi is pierced, Shakti enters Shiva’s domain, the two reunite and perform their bridal dance in an explosion of light, ecstasy and joy, as described earlier. Here, dualities cease, separation no longer exists. The Jiva experiences non-dual consciousness, returns to source and merges back into Brahman, becoming infinite, boundless, universal and absolute. It experiences “that”, the sum total, the absolute of everything that’s good in this world, with all earthly experiences paling in comparison. Generally, this return to non-dual consciousness and unity with Brahman is called Nirvikalpa Samadhi, when returned from, Mahasamadhi, when the Jiva stays merged into Brahman and never returns to the body or samsara in general and Sahaja Samadhi, when the Jiva returns to its physical body to spread the word and teach others, whilst continuing to abide in Brahman, acting as a conduit or channel for the Divine, by which his very presence acts as an inspiration for others to seek out the same path. Some famous sages and teachers, such as Ramana Maharshi belong to this latter category. Those that have been liberated whilst in this body, abiding in the constant bliss of Satchitananda-Brahman and resting in Sahaja Samadhi, which is a natural ecstatic state, are known as Jivanmukta.

&#x200B;

Thus, the Jiva has completed its mission, it has matured to the extent that it can return to source, return from the dualistic, created, illusory universe and come home to rest in its natural state as part of Brahman, in unity consciousness, enjoying absolute bliss, infinite knowledge, boundless love and compassion for all. That is the gist of the Kundalini process, somewhat simplified so it is accessible and easily understandable to all.

1705,"Note: To be clear, I am not asking why Ravana wouldn't be harmed or killed by the Sudarshana Chakra; that's obvious. I'm asking why and under what circumstances Vishnu launched the Sudarshana Chakra at Ravana.]

In the Sundara Kanda of the Valmiki Ramayana, Hanuman sneaks into Ravana's palace and sees Ravana sleeping. And in particular he sees Ravana' arms:

That Hanuman also saw the wealthy Ravana's arms tied with golden armlets thrown apart, resembling flag staffs raised in honor of Indra. Those arms had wounds made by stabbing from the pointed edges of tusks of Iraavata and fleshy shoulders smeared with diamond and hit by Vishnu chakra.

My question is, what is the story of Vishnu hitting Ravana with his Sudarshana Chakra (discus weapon)? This excerpt from the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana describes how when Ravana was attacking Devaloka, Indra asked Vishnu for help in fighting Ravana. But Vishnu refused, saying that Ravana had a boon that he couldn't be killed by any god, but that he would soon incarnate on the Earth as Rama to defeat him:

Do not fear, hear what I have to say. He is invincible by virtue of the boon, and that vicious-souled one is incapable of being vanquished even by the celestials and Asuras. Irrepressible by virtue of his prowess, that Rakshasa, with his son, shall accomplish a mighty object. O lord of celestials, even if I am requested by thee, I shall not withstand the Rakshasa, Ravana in the conflict. Without slaying the enemies in the encounter Vishnu doth never go back — but it is hard to fulfill my desire from Ravana, well protected by the boon. However I do promise before thee, O lord of the Devas, O performer of hundred sacrifices, I shall, soon become the cause of this Rakshasa's death. I shall soon destroy Ravana with his family in due time and afford delight unto the Devas. I speak the truth unto thee, O king of the Devas, O lord of Sachi; do thou divested of fear, fight, O thou gifted with great strength, along with the Devas.

So if Vishnu didn't fight Ravana during the battle of Devaloka, when did he hit Ravana's shoulder with the Sudarshana Chakra?"

1718,"It can be quite difficult to navigate the philosophy of Advaita Vedānta if one is not acquainted with the siddhānta’s two-fold perspective of reality- as empirical and absolute.

Advaita Vedānta believes that the world of name and form has empirical reality but not absolute reality. From the standpoint of empirical reality, Advaitins admit of the creation of the world from Īśvara’s Līlā. God creates the world at the beginning of every kalpa to allot creatures with bodies according to their past karma. From Īśvara proceeds the subtle elements, followed by the gross elements, which combine in various ways to form the manifold jagat. From the perspective of vyavahārika, the jīvā is the reflection of Īśvara conditioned by the mind (antahkārana). The jīvā is beginning-less and has dwelt samsāra from eternity owing to its avidyā. Out of compassion towards jīvās, Īśvara reveals the Veda which teaches the twofold dharma of pavrtti and nivrtti, so that they may achieve prosperity (abhyudaya) and happiness (nishreyas). By pursuing one’s enjoined duties selflessly and by earning the grace of the Lord, one is led to the path of moksa. Moksa consists of coming to the realisation that the Ātman alone is real. This is pure knowledge (jñāna).

Understanding the difference between the vyavahārika and paramārtika perspectives is crucial for distinguishing Advaita Vedānta from forms of nihilism, ethical relativism and atheism."

I don't know whether it's offensive or not, this is from Guru Astakam. I apologize if it's offensive. Just wanted to see how the verse looks like with ""Self"". Isn't Self considered the ultimate guru after all?"
1720,"Jagadguru  Adi Shankaracharya undertook his Digvijaya Yatra along the entire length & breadth of Bharat and in the course of it, successfully established the supremacy Of Advaita Vedanta by defeating scholars of various faiths & schools of thought in spite of accepting the validities and values of all diverse ideas & thus, united the disentangled Bharat civilization  & revived Sanatan Hindu Dharma & Sanskriti. His philosophy talks about the Atman in all living beings, the divinity of the individual and the supreme Brahman, the ultimate and formless reality, the unification of Atman and Brahman leading to moksha. Many centuries later Swami Vivekananda revived the fragmented sanatan dharma by introducing others to Guru Shankaracharya's philosophy and thus continuing his works.

I'm new and don't know much about hinduism but i really want to know more. I'm a little nervous to go because I don't know the customs but I feel pulled to incorporate it into my spiritual practice. 

My questions are:

1.) Is it acceptable to ask the priests there questions without an appointment?

2.) Are you allowed to meditate at the temple and sit in the presence of the deities? 

I'm sure every temple is different but I guess I'm just asking the norm. 

Thank you for your time. 🙏🏼"

And Brahman, calling Kasyapa to him, spake unto him these words, 'O thou pure one who overcomest all enemies, these snakes begotten by you, who are of virulent poison and huge bodies, and ever intent on biting other creatures, have been cursed by their mother. O son, do not grieve for it in the least. The destruction of the snakes in the sacrifice hath, indeed, been ordained long ago'” is absent in debroys version but seem like an important dialogue."

This white American in orange robes told me I am not a Vaishnava because I do not follow his ""ISKCON"" Hare Krishna movement

I feel sick and sad. How someone takes Hindu culture away from born Hindus? This is not right. Everyone should be able to perform seva and bhakti to Sree Krsna Ji. "

**Introduction**

Navratri, the nine-night festival dedicated to Goddess Durga, is one of the most revered Hindu festivals celebrated with great enthusiasm and devotion. During these nine nights, devotees seek blessings from the divine feminine energy that manifests in different forms, collectively known as the Navadurga. Navratri 2023 is just around the corner, and for those who wish to perform the Navratri Puja at home, we have prepared a comprehensive guide on Navratri Puja Vidhi. In this blog, we will guide you through the step-by-step process of **how to do Navratri Puja at home** to ensure a spiritually fulfilling and successful celebration.

**Step 1: Preparations**

Before you begin the **Navratri** Puja, it's essential to make proper preparations. Here's what you need to do:

**1. Cleanse Your Home:** Start by thoroughly cleaning your home. A clean and pure environment is essential for any puja.

**2. Gather Puja Items:** Collect all the necessary items, including a picture or idol of Goddess Durga, flowers, incense sticks, camphor, a diya (lamp), coconut, fruits, sweets, and a Kalash (a metal pot filled with water).

**3. Mentally Prepare:** Set a positive and spiritual mood by meditating or chanting mantras to calm your mind and focus your energy.

**Step 2: Setting Up the Puja Area**

**1. Choose a Clean Space**:Select a clean and quiet area in your home where you will perform the Navratri Puja. Cover it with a clean cloth or mat.

**2. Place the Idol or Picture:** Set up the idol or picture of Goddess Durga on a raised platform. Decorate it with flowers and jewelry.

**Step 3: Kalash Sthapana**

The Kalash Sthapana is a significant ritual during Navratri. Here's how you do it:

**1. Fill the Kalash:** Fill the Kalash with water, add some rice, and place a betel nut, a coin, and some flower petals on top.

**2. Decorate the Kalash:** Cover the neck of the Kalash with mango leaves and tie a thread or red cloth around it.

**3. Place the Kalash:** Place the Kalash near the idol or picture of Goddess Durga.

**Step 4: Invocation of Goddess Durga**

**1. Light the Diya:** Light the diya and incense sticks. Offer these to the goddess while chanting mantras.

**2. Offer Flowers:**Offer fresh flowers to Goddess Durga while reciting her names and attributes.

**3. Offer Fruits and Sweets:** Place fruits and sweets in front of the goddess as a gesture of devotion.

**Step 5: Performing Aarti**

Performing aarti is an essential part of the Navratri Puja. Here's how you can do it:

**1. Light the Camphor:** Light a piece of camphor and offer it to the deity while singing aarti songs.

**2. Wave the Aarti Thali**: Wave the aarti thali in a circular motion in front of the deity to spread positive energy.

**Step 6: Daily Puja Routine**

During the nine days of Navratri, repeat the following routine:

**1. Offer Prayers Daily:** Offer prayers to the Navadurga in the same manner as mentioned above.

**2. Read Durga Saptashati:** Devote some time each day to reading the Durga Saptashati, a sacred text dedicated to Goddess Durga.

3. **Maintain Fasting:** Many devotees fast during Navratri. If you choose to fast, follow the recommended dietary restrictions.

**Step 7: Celebrate Navratri**

Apart from the daily puja, Navratri is also about celebrating the festival with devotion and joy. You can participate in cultural events, dances (Garba and Dandiya), and community gatherings.

**Step 8: Vijayadashami (Dussehra) Ritual**

On the tenth day, also known as Vijayadashami or Dussehra, conclude the Navratri Puja with the following rituals:

**1. Immersion of Kalash:** The water from the Kalash is sprinkled around the house to purify it. The Kalash itself can be immersed in a nearby river or water body.

**2. Exchange of Gifts:** It is customary to exchange gifts and sweets with family and friends to mark the end of Navratri.

**Conclusion**

Navratri is a spiritually enriching festival that allows devotees to connect with the divine feminine energy. By following this step-by-step guide on [**Navratri Puja Vidhi 2023**](https://www.pujanpujari.com/navratri-puja-vidhi-2023/), you can perform the Navratri Puja at home in 2023 with devotion and dedication. **PujaNPujari** wishes you a blessed and prosperous Navratri! May Goddess Durga shower her blessings upon you and your loved ones."
1731,"I'm new to Hinduism and had a question that might be a bit odd, but it's something that popped into my head:

When Vishnu assumed human form in one of his ten avatars, this was just a human incarnation of his, right? If so, was Vishnu still in existence as a separate being at the same time that Rama or Krishna were walking the Earth? Or are they one being, so Vishnu *was* Rama?

This question comes to mind due to the Holy Trinity in Christianity, where the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are all God, but three different entities. So I'm curious what the similarity is. Thank you!"
1732,"I understand there’s puja, strotams, mantras, bhajans, japa and Kirtan but is there any other methods for inner peace while connecting with your isht dev at the same time?"
1734,"1) What does hinduism say about criticism and questioning things as longs as it's done respectfully? Is it allowed ?

2) How can I as a hindu stay strong amidst hinduphobia and people who are ignorant about it ?

3) If i want to attain moksha with the intention of having a definite goal in my mind.. and not because i truly want it, will I still attain it ? I feel like right now it's very fear and compulsion based.. I want to change that.


Thank you, hare Krishn."

Asked him if he would go as well. 
He said that if he would go it would be for one thing so it wasn't worth it. 

I looked for the food item and bought it for him.

1741,"Radhe Radhe! As a practicing Hindu with a Vaishnav faith devoted to Krishna, who also has a passion for sketching erotic artwork and identifies as bisexual, do my personal choices in life make me any less of a Hindu?"
1742,"I'm not Hindu but I have studied some Vaishnavism.

I have been watching that Ramayana serial by Ramanand Sagar with English subtitles, and have reached the episode where Rama breaks Shiva's bow, and then Parashurama barges in among all the princes and kings, and starts getting upset.

Knowing that Parashurama is also a Vishnu avatar, was him getting upset and being in the same room as Rama part of the lila? I mean, logically speaking, God knows everything and it's all His Lila, but Parashurama and Rama in the same room threw me off a little."
1743,"Went out and send this Koi fish with a peculiar spot that looked like a bindi, I thought it was cute and wanted to share to hopefully make you guys smile!"
1744,"So I have been watching Upanishad Ganga, and I recently watched this video. It talks about sage Varahamihir. To my surprise, he talks about space, time, atoms and the idea of creation and destruction of the universe.

So my question is, how true is this episode? If such concepts were already known by Indian sages, why aren't they popular amongst the scientific communities?"
1745,"Out of curiosity today, I took a closer look at the religious studies section of my university's library. The books that I found there were so misrepresentative. Firstly, most of them were written by Westerners who are absolutely not practitioners in any sense of the word. Secondly, instead of talking about the actual practices of our religion, they were instead focused on ""gender"", ""caste"", ""race"" and other social topics. There were a disproportionate amount of books on Tantra as a way to break the ""caste barrier"" or as ""sexual awakening of the oriental"". There was not a single translation of the Bhagwad Gita and the book labeled Bhagwatam was simply cherry-picked opinion essays on certain stories. Then there were countless, biographies of the few saints popular in the Western Sphere. Not to mention there were no Upanishads or the Vedas but there were many copies of Manu Smriti. 

All this makes me believe that we do have a problem at hand here. Libraries are simply full of misrepresentations of our culture, and we must do something about it. I'd love to know everyone else's opinions on this.

PS: I would have attached images of these books but I thought it would be wise to not make others suffer along with me."
1746,"I've been pondering a question that has intrigued me for quite some time: Can practicing mindfulness and being present in the moment influence our experience of karma?

Karma is a concept deeply rooted in various philosophies and spiritual traditions. It's often seen as the principle of cause and effect, where our actions have consequences, both in this life and beyond. Mindfulness, on the other hand, is the practice of being fully aware of the present moment without judgment.

I can't help but wonder if there's a connection between these two concepts. Does being mindful and living in the present moment affect the karma we accumulate? Can it shape the outcomes of our actions and the events that unfold in our lives?

I'd love to hear your thoughts and insights on this matter. Have you noticed any personal experiences or stories that might shed light on this intriguing relationship? Let's dive into this thought-provoking question together!"
1747,"Hey everyone, I was exploring options to learn more about and use the Panchang calendar. I would appreciate any leads for any apps and/or websites for Panchang.

1748,"The Four Yugas serve as the foundation on which Hindu cosmology is built; they embody a cycle of time and life that repeats infinitely. These four epochs, namely the Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga, and Kali Yuga, represent the spiritual and ethical growth of mankind. The Satya Yuga –the initial stage– stands for cleanliness and verity: a period replete with righteousness and spirituality, where mankind coexists harmoniously with nature stems from its divine origins.

Transitioning into Treta Yuga further downplays righteousness witnessed in the previous stage. Subsequent Dvapara Yuga signifies decline to morality through material worship leading to respect for ceremonies and tradition. Ultimately darkest Kali Yuga is a period where traits like treachery, selfishness, covetousness gain prominence ruling over inner goodness with increasing reliance on material accruals turning humans blind towards what constitutes truth & importance of divine self-discovery. This appears to be the age we currently exist in – Kali Yuga- steep mess caused by degenerating morals existence amongst masses plummeting spiritual knowledge during more recent timelines forcing people towards wrongful methods mainly originating from self-willed objectives-basis. Despite ever-changing recurring nature attached to these cycles; each offers a lesson underlining the importance of sustaining moral values in spite of these unavoidable deteriorations progressively diminishing around us. This cyclic flow informs us how vital following ethics seem even in the midst of age covering us, realising eventually this journey from rise decline proving assimilating virtues can enable under constant transition striving upwards closer reaching state heightened consciousness signifies genuine refinement truly achieved surpassing limitations attached to individual ages."

1753,"The immediacy of social media means actions often receive instant reactions. Post anything, and the community responds, almost mirroring the idea of instant karma. Depending on the baises and learnings they have.

1768,"So I recently started as a devotee of Lord Krishna.was chanting Hare Krishna Occasionally and listening to bhajans also fasted on Janmasthami and everything was fine. But day before yesterday after listening to a TRS podcast which had Sir Rajarshi Nandi, I came to know about Kal Bhairava and his child form Vatuka Bhairava. He mentioned that Vatuka Bhairava is best to worship in today's age as he is very easy to approach. As I am also going through a lot of difficulties right now I thought maybe doing Bhairava Upasana while still having Krishna as my Istha devta would be nice so I asked Krishna for guidance.The very next day my mom gave me a rudraksha bangle to wear on my hand and also I came across videos where it mentioned about Tantric aspects of Krishna and How Krishna, Kali and Shiva are one. So taking them as a sign I went to Baba Kal Bhairava's temple today and Although I didn't make any Sankalpa I asked Baba to guide me and also told him that I will be doing Vatuka Bhairava Mantra Jaapas and Upasanas tomorrow but now that I came home I came across Canto 1 of Srimad bhagavatam that said Krishna Devotees only worship and surrender to Vishnu's form and not Demi-Gods. I  just know that Shiva And Vishnu are one and both lead to the same liberation path. But now I feel bad for surrendering to Shree Krishna once and still Going to Baba Bhairava for guidance. I feel like that way  I disrespected both Lord Bhairava And Lord Krishna and now both are angry with me. I am very confused as I don't know if I should chang Krishna names for Bhairava Mantras.I also feel like maybe  Lord Bhairava will get angry with me for I told him that I wanted to and will start His Japa from tomorrow although didn't make any promises. What do you guys recommend since I don't have any Guru I need suggestion from you all."

Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, etc. are well known in our country.
There are also many books introducing the religions.
But not much is known about Hinduism, only the Ganges, yoga, and cows.
How do actual Hindus live their religious lives? Is there a fixed day of the week for worship? I wonder what you think of God and what norms you have (for example, in Islam you learn to obey, in Christianity you learn to love, and in Buddhism you learn to be a Buddha yourself"

But I'm reading the puran on my phone and planning to complete it today. Would it be ok if I continue reading it on my phone?"
1781,"I'm currently reading the Bhagavad Gita, and in Chapter 2, Verse 13, Sri Krishna advises Arjuna not to grieve for the loss of life. He explains that the self transitions from childhood to youth and from youth to old age, just as it moves from one body to another. Therefore, grieving for it is irrelevant. My question is, if we can remember events from our childhood, youth, and old age (may be not all but definitely few) why can't we remember memories from our previous lives?

My current understanding is that it's not the self but rather our physical body that retains memories. Once the body is gone, the memories are lost as well. However, I feel there's more to it than just that. Without delving into metaphysics, are there any texts within Vedanta or Hinduism that discuss this topic? What are your interpretations of this concept?"

What if we are facing so much crime today because these criminals too were meant to die the first time they contacted Polio,influenza,cholera,Hepetiatis etc at birth but vaccination prolonged their death ? Are doctors working against God ? "
1784,Does anyone do specific pujas or do you customize your own? I’ve read that some people just light the lamp and incense and do a quick prayer or japa and I am wondering how much everyone here does their own puja.
1786,"I’m living in South India right now, a little far away from the established centres of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. I’m in that stage of discovering Gaudiya Vaishnavism where I want to meet fellow devotees. Beyond ISKCON, I really want to know if someone can help me with how and where I can meet and interact with fellow devotees? I have no leads."
1788,I have seen so many school of thoughts and sects in Hindusim but I want to know if there are some facts or literature upon which all or majority will agree upon. Example can be like most Christains believe Jesus is king or son of God and worship him. Is there any piece of text on which all Hindus will unite upon or agree ? 
1789,"So I recite hanuman chalisa every night before bed and listen to Hariharan’s Sankatmochan Hanuman Ashtak right after. 
For some reason, Hanuman chalisa always empowers me and Hanuman Ashtak makes me vulnerable, almost at the mercy of bajrang bali. I feel like surrendering to him, and it just makes me cry every damn time. 

Just wanted to share this, with my fellow seekers. 
Jai Bajrang Bali❤️"
1790,"VERY new to Hinduism. I was born and raised a  Christian in the southern United States and always felt that religion was scary, chauvinistic, and judgemental… all things I am not. I pushed away religion my whole life and have avoided anything related to prayer or church for as long as I can remember. Then I found ISKCON. Though I find it a bit too restrictive for me, I found a joy and power in ecstatic chanting that I’d never experienced before. I know this altar isn’t traditional, as I didn’t base it off anything but my heart, but chanting and praying before it has helped me immensely in so many ways. I am so happy to have found such a beautiful and expansive faith in Hinduism. 🥰🕉️"
1791,"Does anyone has positive evidence/experiences that our loved ones guide and wait for us in other realm? Are they happier there? Or still regret their loss? 

Does babas with siddhis can help us communicate? Or someone has some sort of such experience. Ive lost my father and won't be able to live normal whole life without him. Just need some support."
1792,"What are your thoughts on the book 'the liberation of sita' by Lalita Kumari.Its being taught in our university and I feel this book portrays Shri Rama in a wrong way and even the author is more inclined towards her feminist views.For ex. Killing of Ravana is all politics,all men are the same.
Its a very short book pls read and do give your views on this as I'm curious why our college being a Christian one is teaching feminist views on ramayana(hindu) and also there was a teaching of Mahabharata too on how the yudh was totally wrong and could've been avoided.
Do comment on the following
Edit : just saw the book says it's a work of fiction
But it does make it look real in front of everyone as the characters are same as in ramayana"
1793,"If i want to be in Hinduism can i Worship Lord Ganesha as brahman as im drawn closer and closer to him ? I have heard about Ganapatya Sampradaya and i have some questions...  


1.How does worshipping Ganesha as parabrahman look like as parabrahman is unborn and Ganesha is the son of Lord Shiva and Parvati?"
1794,"I recently started reading the Gita and I have a very silly doubt.

There's a line that says that the only means to go beyond the cycle of birth and death is to do yagya/ meditate and to chant the name of the supreme god called OM. If one tries to achieve this through any other god but the supreme being that means that he/she is being ignorant and their meditation bears no fruition.

So, who is this supreme being, what is OM. What I can make of it is that the supreme god is a cosmic entity that our gods are a manifestation of. But who is this supreme god? And am I being ignorant if I chose to meditate in the name of Lord Shiva??"
1795,"What if our ancestors were closer to the simulation theory than we are currently.

The atman, correct me if I am wrong. Which is my trueself or ""I"" is actually the player which is controlling me in this simulation and that's why everything is Maya since till the time i am not observing from my sense nothing exist.

Think of it this way, when we are playing a game we are mostly unaware of our surrounding, but since only our eyes and ears are engaged we can easily come out of it. What if the simulation we are in is completely affecting all our senses? 

Anyone who may get offended,  i don't mean any disrespect to sanatan. This just came to my head so want people's philosophical opinion. 

After all we all are not believers and instead seekers right?

🙏 Namaste."

1806,"My mom has an undiagnosed mental illness (OCD) that has a huge impact on me and my family. She is obsessed with cleaning and having us avoid all germs and anything she deems ""unclean"". She refuses to seek help for it and screams at us if we point out ways in which it affects us. The thing is she views her OCD as almost a strength, because she is able to maintain a high order of cleanliness, which, to her, is good. I appreciate that she takes the trouble to keep things clean and, of course, being disorganized and messy is not good either, but this high degree of cleanliness feels like the other extreme. And neither extreme is good. I feel frustrated at times and I try to remember that this illness affects her life too. However, I'm in my early 20s, and my mother's actions from her illness really limit my life and I feel like I can't do simple things in her presence without her saying I'm doing it incorrectly or in an ""unclean"" way. Also, I’d like to add that I am not in the position to move out due to cultural traditions. But I also want to say that I really do love being around her and am close to her when she is not triggered by her OCD. Some days, however, it feels very restrictive and frustrating when we have arguments about this that seem to go nowhere. The rest of my family feels this way too but we are unsure of what to do. I do understand the value of seeking treatment/therapy for mental health. My family and I would certainly support her if she chose to seek help. But the problem is we can’t help her if she doesn’t want to help herself. I’m deeply unsure of what to do, and feel myself wanting to ask God for help. Any mention of OCD or how it affects us, triggers her and makes me and the rest of the family feel like the bad guys. I have grown up Hindu and am still religious, but I feel that I almost lack direction when it comes to taking a spiritual approach to this issue. Praying and taking steps to improve your own mental health is one thing, but I am unsure of how to effectively pray for someone else’s mental health. My family and I would love it if she would seek help for her OCD and hopefully improve her life and ours. But to do that she first has to realize herself that her OCD is a struggle, not an asset. I don’t know if there’s any guidance in Hinduism to help with this, but I would greatly appreciate any advice."
1807,"Hi there! I am a student in fashion school and I am doing a historical recreation project. 
I saw a shadow puppet of Hanuman at my local museum and after doing extensive research on Hanuman, felt strongly about recreating the puppet into a 3D form with fashion design. I was wondering if this would be considered disrespectful, or if it is allowed at all? I don’t want to disrespect the religion or deity. if it is allowed, what limitations are there when using the likeliness of a deity in art form(specifically fashion)? 

Please let me know soon! I am very interested in Hanuman, and love his story. But I will definitely pick something else if it is seen as disrespectful or off putting.

I'm 28 years old and came to Hinduism almost 12 months ago, I had a lifetime of curiosity and being drawn to Lord Vishnu and the best thing I ever did was taking the plunge and allowing my curiosity to take over so I can learn and grow. The Gita changed my life. 

I always believed in the idea of God but couldn't connect with anything and the Abrahamic faiths just felt violent and hateful. Vaishnvaism gave me the explanation of God and the spiritual practise I'd been seeking my whole life.

I practise a few paths including Jnana, Bhakti, Japa, Karma and Dhyana.

Through Jnana, my knowledge of Brahman has increased 10 fold and I feel like my relationship with Vishnu is growing but I also have this little voice that is questioning my practices and I feel this is slowing me down.

I do Puja and mantra mediation everyday, I like Puja, the ritual allows me to feel the Lord and my mediation has improved to the point where all I can hear is the Mantra, everything else is silent, but I don't feel it's powers. While I haven't received diksha as such, I was educated by a local Acharya on the Ashtakshara Mantra and this is all I chant

Many on this sub reddit have revealed spiritual awakenings, this hasn't occurred to me. 

How can I expand my Bhakti so Lord Vishnu is pleased? Will he be pleased with what I'm doing already? How will I know if my spirit has awakened? Should I do anything differently or stop doing something?"
1835,"I(a class 12th student) had to give a speech that would carry marks, and I've had severe stage fright since childhood, haven't been able to present one single speech without fumbling or getting stuck, and so I was pretty anxious the day I had to speak, my heart rate shooting up, nervousness taking over, so I just started chanting the Hare Krishna mahamantra in my mind continuously, and this might seem like a coincidence to many, but not only did I speak confidently without getting stuck, but even my friends praised me for speaking well, hey Krishna, my elder brother,  thank you🙏🏻"
1836,"On the day of Janmashtami, a few quotes that will be beneficial for everyone. 

To work alone you have competence, and not to claim their fruits. Let not the longing for fruits be the motive force of your action. At the same time let not this attitude confirm you in indolent inaction. - **Swami Vivekananda** ([BG 2.47](https://vivekavani.com/b2v47/)) 

**Paramahansa Yogananda** \- ""When you perform your duties selflessly, without being attached to the fruits of your actions, you awaken your true self.""

If you are crawling through your work, that is karma. If you are dancing through your work, that is karma yoga. - **Sadhguru**

""The Karma Yogi is the man who understands that the highest ideal is non-resistance, and who also knows that this non-resistance is the highest manifestation of power in actual possession, and also what is called the resisting of evil is but a step on the way toward the manifestation of this highest power, namely, non-resistance."" - **Swami Vivekananda**

**Sadhguru**: Once you renounce the fruit of action, action will come easily. Once someone simply does it for the love of what they are doing, and above all because they want someone else to enjoy it, it does not matter whether they get to sit there too or not. Once you renounce the fruit of action, action is not entangling. It is never what you do which entangles you. It is the expectation of what you should get which entangles you. Just observe yourself – wherever you do action without expectation, what is your experience? Wherever you do action with expectation, what is your experience? If you look at that, you will speak Gita.

How can you apply Karma Yoga in your life, office etc.? What changes have you seen while applying it?

1) What are the differences between groups/teachers like ISKCON, Pure Bhakti, and Vinod Baba? Why does Vinod Baba look more like what I would associate with a typical sadhu vs the clean shaven ISKCON bhaktis? And why are some ISKCON members like Aindra Prabhu shown wearing a beard often?

2) ISKCON doesn't allow things like coffee, eggs, garlic and onion. Is this for all Guadiya Vaishnavis, only for the initiated, or only ISKCON?

3) My nearest ISKCON is an hours drive from me which at this time is not practical for me. Would it be impossible to be a member of such groups as Pure Bhakti, ISKCON, etc. and not be able to attend services in person/be initiated or can an individual be a ""solitary"" bhakti?

After my awakening, for 8 months I lived at home and was having this belief that if one is really conscious they can fully awaken no matter where they are and what situations they are faced with.
But I can't keep living at my home...One day I'm high in energies and meditative other day I'm fully wasting my time and energies in useless things.
I have decided that I need to leave and I'm not scared of anything, I want to surrender to krishna, and it's not some hypothetical idea, some days when I'm really connected I can feel universal energies, but it doesn't stay for long as I get distracted by work and all the other things.
How do I go about this? I don't have a lot of money and I don't wanna entangle in money either. I've heard about old yogis who left their home for sadhanas but I don't know how new age people go about this...
I'm 24 and and female.
Nothing can change decision I just want to know how to manage it?

1852,"Hello Fellow Sanatanis,  
I am currently in a situation where the goal i am working for seems so so far beyond me that it feels impossible and the bad circumstances i am in only make it seem more impossible. Yet, i am determined that i will give it my all. 

In hard times such as this i am reminded of Sri Krishna's words in the Gita -->

 **कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।**  
**मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥ २-४७** 

*""You have the right to work only but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction""*

Reading this , i am able to prevent myself from inaction (more on that later) . I am also able to mentally detach myself from focusing on what i cannot control such as my circumstances and whether or not i get my goal and focusing only on my actions - my karma.

There are two problems i am facing in fully implementing this practically-

1. **The first problem comes when i face an obstacle or am not making progress**  
For ex- If am working to score good marks on a major test, i am studying but repeatedly failing to score good marks on the practice tests repeatedly. Shouldn't i try a different approach?   
Like take a look at my practice tests results, analyze them, take feedback and then try a different strategy of studying but then wouldn't that be *""being attached or weighing or scrutinizing the fruit of action""?*   
How does changing approaches/strategies/tactics if you are failing weigh in the *""right to action but not the fruit""* shloka?  

2. **The second problem comes in regards to motivation to work**  
If i cannot be motivated by the fruit of action , then what should i be motivated by?   
If i detach myself from the motive of the fruit, i fall to inaction  
I understand the answer to it could be ""the desire to do what's right or what's dharma or what's your duty "" but in the present world of today, not everyone wants to do it.   
Even if let's say i do, how does this apply to personal goals (For ex: If i want to buy a certain house or  crack an exam or say develop a muscular body ) ? If i cannot be motivated by the fruit i.e the end goal i am working for, than what will cause me to take any action at all?

1853,"From my understanding, in the view of Advaita Vedanta, Māyā is ignorance of our true nature as Brahman, and it is because of Māyā that we perceive duality. That raises the question for me of why Māyā appears to be in the first place, if it's not a part of the fundamental reality. 

&#x200B;

I have listened to Swami Sarvapriyananda's lecture on Māyā and the main point of his that I perceived was that Māyā appears like a tiger in a dream, and just like how we can't explain how the tiger got into the dream, there is no causation for the appearance of Māyā. But, our dreams are made up of memories in our minds. If someone never saw a tiger, they wouldn't dream about it, so the tiger in the dream has a cause, even if that cause isn't related to the dream itself.

&#x200B;

The tiger appeared in the dream, but the dream itself is illusion as seen from the waking state.

&#x200B;

Duality appears in the waking state, but duality is an illusion obscuring the truth of non-dual Brahman.

&#x200B;

So what is the 'cause' for Māyā in Advaita Vedanta? Māyā may not be any more real than the tiger in the dream, but dreaming requires a dreamer, and the dreamer is none other than Brahman veiled by Māyā. Why would Brahman ""dream"" duality when duality is just Māyā, which, again, doesn't exist in non-dual Brahman?

&#x200B;

Any resources recommended would be greatly appreciated."
1854,"I have been Hindu my whole life, I’ve connected with different deities throughout my life and have always felt the strongest connection to God (Krishna, Hanuman Ji, Ashapura Ma, Ganapati Bapa) in my most difficult moments of life. 

I consider myself very lucky, very blessed in this life with little hardships as such compared to others. I have an amazing family, lovely friends, the health of my loved ones, I went to a great school, got great education, a beautiful home and when I wanted a job two years i got one.

 Now, I’ve been struggling to find a job in a new industry (which I have experience in from my personal projects and passions so have many applicable skills but no professional experience as such) for over 5 months and spend many days and nights crying from heartache. Feeling fatigued. Feeling useless or unsuccessful. Feeling like I don’t want to wake up another day and go through the same heartbreak, rejection and struggle. I feel so disappointed in myself that I’m not where I want to be in life. However I wake up each day trying to put in effort. 

I speak and cry to God and I am sure I am being heard, even on the days I can’t turn my tears into words I know they are my prayers God hears me. How can I be sure to pray to God in a sincere way so that my prayers can be answered? God has come through for me in all of my most difficult seasons, but I don’t know why I’m having a hard time connecting with my faith in this season and believing everything will work out for me. I struggle believing in myself so I only have God to rely on. Maybe because I’ve never been out of work for so long. Maybe this season of my life is happening so God can remind me nothing can be done without him.

 I know even now, God hears me because I crossed paths with a lovely lady who has been helping me and even got me an interview! I just want to have a more positive mindset and be closer to my faith but sometimes I struggle with conflicting information as Hinduism is so vast and I often lack direction with it. I still continue to show gratitude for all my blessings and constantly affirm that God is protecting me and working things out for me even when I do not see it with own two eyes. Do I just continue speaking to God as though we are friends? Do I ask or pray for anything specific? How can I enhance Gods presence in my life? Thanks for any guidance."

1875,"8 Life Lessons We Can Learn From Bhagavad Geeta

### 1. Focus on Your Goal Instead of the Result:

It's important to know what your goal is. Aim to reach the top of your field. That is why Bhagavad Gita stresses the importance of performing your duties rather than focusing on the goal. By focusing on rewards, you increase your chances of worrying when failure happens. If the result doesn't favor you, you may also feel depressed. Focusing on the target is therefore always recommended. Achieving your goal will bring you more rewards.

### 2. Be Never Afraid:

Even humans have been created by the Supreme Power in differing ways - or as I like to say, each of them is a masterpiece. Never shy away from your goal simply because you are afraid that everything you do will work against it. Don't expect anything in return. Fears and expectations are the ones that limit and restrict us. Bhagavad Gita gives us a useful lesson that can influence our future. Death is perhaps our greatest fear. The fear of one day losing our lives is an all-encompassing fear many of us have during our lives. The unknown is our greatest fear. As Lord Krishna instructs his devotee Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, death need never be feared. The embodied soul passes through the cycles of boyhood, youth, and old age, just like the soul. At death, the embodied soul moves into another body. This is why death is merely a transition. Such change never fools a wise man. Even our bodies are temporary, all materialistic objects on this planet are temporary, and death is a necessary part of life.

### 3. Everything will work out in the end:

In everything that has happened, in everything that is happening, and in everything that will happen in the future, nothing but good will happen. Most of us are troubled by dwelling so long in the past that we forget to live in the present and look forward to the future. Worrying about things that cannot be changed is pointless, so what's the point? God has it all figured out, so it's always best to have faith in him. Do not act on baseless concerns about the past or the future. Live in the here and now.

### 4. Life and Death:

Life and death are interconnected for all of us. Living in a materialistic world is part of our everyday existence. There are no boundaries. An essential part of our existence is action, an activity that gives our lives meaning. We are always involved with this grand cycle of events, regardless of whether we like it or not. The problem is that if we run from our responsibilities, we can't move forward. We must perform our duties with utmost dedication, and without overthinking the results, if we want peace, and to achieve satisfaction. This is how we can progress. Action is the best antidote to despair, whereas inaction is the greatest evil."
1876,"I’m from a Hindu family but have a pretty basic understanding of Hinduism. I read some scriptures and in a way I don’t necessarily agree with some things written.

1883,"I have read it, but, I can't precisely remember the chapter & parva. And, it's way too many chapter to actually look. I did try for 1 hour, but didn't succeed, so I thought it would be good to seek some help. Can someone help?"
1884,"Ok so Humans can and will make decisions based on what is good or bad and choose to do good deeds or bad deeds for which they will be sent to Hell Or Heaven.

But what about animals? 

they just follow their instinct,they have to kill to eat but it is not the same for humans they can choose what to eat."
1888,"I am wondering how hindus choose what god or goddess to devote their prayers to. Also, I read somewhere that some gods are off-limits to women in terms of devotion, such as Hanuman. Can someone explain why some gods are off-limit and what gods are so for women?"
1889,"Manu is the first man, and after Matsya warned him of the great flood of Ekarnava, he rescued the vedas and the Saptarshi. So if the Saptarshi come before Manu, are they men? Or are they Devas, Apsaras, etc?"
1892,So i am 19 years old I am preparing for neet exam so can anyone recommend some slokas for me to pray daily pls 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
1894,"i understand that there is a basic divine behind all of the gods and goddesses in hinduism, and ive seen this referred to as brahman or shakti. yet there seems to be a bit of duality in a way in brahman and shakti; that brahman is called the fire while shakti is called the fires power to burn, that brahman is referred to a lot as him, while shakti is her, but ive also seen brahman referred to as being capable of both him and her. what is  the whole fire? what is the divine root of the whole fire? im having a hard time putting this into words and i hope you understand my question. is shakti or brahman the fundamental divine behind it all or both? or a more basic root than either? also im having a realllllly hard time finding text on just what the divine is in hinduism, youtube only gives me videos like “who is the most handsome god in hinduism”. ive been suggested a book on sri ramakrishna that i plan to read but im not sure that it’s specifically on the divine. 
  
EDIT: i feel like hinduism separates the divine up with different terminology/aspects? is there a word for the whole or basic divine? by whole or basic divine im not referring to the all, which would include unenlightened beings if im saying that correctly, but that basic divine divine, not split up into aspects but the basic root behind it, that which is fully enlightened to put it simply. i guess you might have said what it is but im not familiar with the terminology yet"
1895,"Hare Krishna fellow devotees, kind of started practicing Hinduism recently (was born a Hindu but wasn't a serious one), I just wanted to know if we can use things made out of Leather i.e purses, belts etc."
1896,Do we have to blindly believe in scripture or can we question it? 
1898,"So at our family prayer cabinet at home, we have a lotta small sculptures & figurines of deities (made from clay, wood, stone, metal, you name it). And if my eyesight can be trusted, i think they’re all in pretty good shape. 

But my question is, in the event that a deity sculpture or small statue somehow gets damaged (like a limb, head or hand is broken off), well then what do u do then? Is it treated like a “bad unlucky omen” and disposed of?  Or is it simply just mended/fixed and can be placed in the altar? 

I just wanna know just in case something like that ever happens, i mean the only thing i can remember accidentally breaking at home was just a regular sculpture of an elephant, and my dad just fixed it with super-glue. But since we’re talking about actual swami murtis, i was wondering if the approach is different 

Thx 👍🏾"
1899,"Okay so I have been reading few things regarding Sanatan dharma that it's not a religion but more of a way of life or a philosophy. So basically we can't actually compare hinduism with any other religion for say Islam or Christianity as it would be stupidity to compare a book and a book shelf. I can be a polytheist, monotheist or an atheist and still call myself a hindu or sanatani. So what exactly are the pillars which will stop me from identifying myself  as a hindu ?
And for example if tomorrow I change my religion and accept Islam or Christianity , can I still call myself a hindu ?"

1903,"Hi! I'm looking for Youtube channels and podcasts to keep learning about Hinduism while I do my daily walks. I have found some but I don't want to fall into false information so I'm trusting your experience on this and your recommendations.

A little bit of bg story: my first interest for Hinduism began when I was 16 and discovered Yoga. Unfortunately at the time my yoga instructor was more of a new ager than a Hindu student, though she had many idols in her studio (my favorite has always been Shiva) and chanted mantras regularly. When I would ask her more about the faith, she wasn't able to respond and at that time there was not that much info available, especially in my country (Argentina). I enjoyed yoga and mantras so much, but due to lack of instruction I eventually lost interest and later converted to Christianity. I'm grateful for Christianity because it helped me to have something to nurture my thirsty soul everyday, and it provided a structure and shelter, but if I had known what I'm learning now about Hinduism I probably wouldn't have converted to Christianity. Nowadays I'm going back to that first sparkle of divine searching, when I was a teenager, to go back to where I left and keep walking that path... I missed yoga so much, missed chanting mantras so much, but I stopped out of fear for it being demonic (one of the effects of mainstream Christianity) because my life went downhill when I turned 18, so I had to search for an explanation to why that happened and Christianity served me with the ""I was practicing demonic stuff"" explanation, and I stuck with that. Plus the new age movement didn't give me a solid foundation and I went about practicing whatever was trending without proper understanding. 

Fastforward to nowadays: I started meditating again a few months ago every day (5 min at a time because I don't want to burn out and end up not meditating at all) doing 4-7-8 breathwork, and recently picked up a daily yoga practice (10-15 min a day). If you have any recommendations for what I could add to this routine, I'd appreciate it a lot. I'm going to start reading what is recommended in the main post of this subreddit as well. Thank you ❤️"
1904,"Since I was a child, I've been really interested in snakes, especially the ones with hoods. Whenever I had the chance to make something out of clay, I would sculpt an amazing hooded cobra. Being in nature or spending time alone at the beach always makes me feel at home.

I'm from Kerala, where there are special shrines deep in the jungles dedicated to Naga deities. The older generations saw the Naga deities as protectors of nature, bringers of good weather, and those who ensured safe childbirth.

I believe that the Naga deities guide me in life, and I've felt that they want me to do something for them. They've even visited me in my dreams during a tough phase when I had certain addictions. They have a unique way of appearing and scaring me in my dreams, which pushed me to quit my addictions.

I have a deep love for the Naga deities, but I'm struggling to connect with them. They seem to be calling me, but I don't know how to respond. I'm seeking advice and suggestions on the most reliable and ancient techniques for worshipping and connecting with the Naga deities.

Only shall the people reply who sees a truth in this experience I had. I do not wish to see any answers or advices which has an intention to part me from my belief. Thank you."

1910,"I believe that everyone reading this has once made a promise to God! Which are just promises to self in disguise , it's just we like to include god in every aspect of our life so why not promises! 
Also as human beings we tend to break promises. Myself for example I made a promise to God I will be following celibacy for atleast a week before going off business. I have been successful in that for 95% but have failed once is that equal to failure or something?

My option being: promises which on breaking does not cause harm to anyone in any kind is acceptable, sometimes it's the motive /will behind the promise.
 Will to go walk on road of self improvement. And failures do happen. Would you/any scripture  call it failure? 

Do such failure to keep up to a promise add to karma? The answer online have been mixed so any help is appreciated.. Even your opinion on the same"

1) Is it because of their deeds in past life form, does it have any effect ?
2) Is there any way i can get to knw(through yoga, scriptures?) when will I or my parents or my closed ones will leave their mortal bodies, who'll leave first. Can we have control over that by any means ( worshipping god, doing good deed for the welfare of society etc.?)"

1926,"Hello all,

I hope you are all well.

I have a question regarding Samkhya philosophy and its perception.

People say that Samkhya is purely dualistic, but do they not follow the Upanishads which hold Brahman as the utlimate principle of reality? Is Samkhya not really dual aspect monism?

I also saw this in a university paper:

""Samkhya sees the whole universe as an effect of an underlying ultimate cause. The real- ity of the universe is undeniable. Something must come out of something. Nothing can come out of nothing. The universe comes out of its ultimate cause. According to Samkhya, since the reality of the universe is undeniable, the reality of its cause is unde- niable as well.""

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear your thoughts!

&#x200B;

Thank you!"

1932,"Namaste everyone,

I am getting married soon and want my wedding to be a true, hindu wedding. 

For example, rather than Bollywood songs, I would like to have live musicians playing classical Indian music/ragas on sitar/santoor/tablas. 

I want it to be as divine, and rooted in Hinduism as possible. I feel like weddings nowadays have lost their spirit. 
Do any of you have any tips on how I can do this? Of course, we will follow the ceremonies and such for the actual wedding as set out by Hinduism, but are there other things I can do to make it a very Sattvik atmosphere? 

ETA - I am North Indian (gujarati) so will have traditions based on that. 

Thank you in advance!"

1934,"for some reason, as I go into deep meditation, there is usually a visual perception of a blue eye looking at me, and I don't know why. It's such a strong visualization that it feels almost real, somewhere between a dream and reality. I tried to ignore it and focus on my practice, as it should be done, but when I was doing a lot of meditation, I started getting these visualizations of that eye even when I lay down to sleep at night."
1935,"Since I was a child, the achievement of mystical siddhis through yoga, meditation, and Tantra has always been an interest of mine.

However in this digital world I'm also wary of fake images and videos. They tarnish the reality of what could be possible and has been achieved by many great saints and yogis.

To that extent what do you think of this video? Is it real or fake?"
1937,"I'm a believer that we actually go from iron, to bronze, to silver, to gold, we ascend into harmony rather than descend into conflict.

I notice how over the course of history, there's -less- war now. Women's rights haven't gotten worse over time, they've gotten progressively better.

The sharing of knowledge increases every day, as does multiculturalism.

What if we start in the dark age and gradually evolve into the light?

Part of starting in the dark age would be getting lied to, cheated, and conspired against, which we all know from the Gita verse 10:36, commentated by Swami Prabhupada, Krishna is most capable of.

I think we need to spread the evidence that we aren't degenerating, rather we are getting better. The spread of this knowledge will add momentum to our evolution into peace.

Praise Krishna."

1945," For many, the **Hanuman Chalisa** is a timeless hymn, immortalizing Hanuman’s unwavering devotion to Lord Rama. Yet, this 40-verse masterpiece by Tulsidas is more than a beautiful homage to a divine figure. It’s a reflective surface, revealing the immense potential housed within every individual. This ancient scripture doesn’t just extol Hanuman’s spiritual odyssey but beckons us to awaken the reservoirs of power and spirituality latent within. As we journey through this series, we will unveil the layers of this revered text, spotlighting a message that rises above religious confines, resonating with the very core of human existence.

1947,I feel sorry every time someone calls Nazi symbol a Swastika. It’s happenes most of the time in western countries.  Nazi symbol is reverse of Swastika and in black color (instead Swastika is red).  Swastika has a deep meaning in Hindu culture and I feel people needs to be educated and be aware to not call Swastika as a Nazi symbol.  I personally was told to remove swastika image from a Diwali festival slide because people may feel offended.  Why do we have to suppress our culture?   How can we educate people and news media?

1951," I am inquiring about the reasons behind the selective worship of children of Hindu deities, particularly in cases like Lord Shiva's offspring, such as Lord Ganesha and Lord Kartikeya, who are indeed revered. However, it is noticeable that children of other prominent deities like Lord Krishna and Lord Rama do not seem to receive similar levels of veneration. I am interested in understanding the theological or cultural factors that contribute to this distinction. Your insights on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you "

Do you have any personal experiences or stories where you felt you escaped karma, or it eventually caught up with you?"
1956,"I usually worship lord shiva from many years. Never really worshiped Sri Krishna or gave much thought to Bhagavad Gita.

I am mentally chanting and singing sri Krishna name and songs. I am so confused. What's happening tome? , and how do I proceed from here?"
1957,"So I'm thinking about this question for quite some time. Any metaphysical concept like Karma, does have central theme that you need to believe on without asking for proofs and if you can't prove something with reasoning and sicentific methodology and still believe in it then it becomes superstition. On the other hand  Karma is a belief system, that encourages individuals to consider the consequences of their actions and promotes ethical behavior. For example, someone who believes in karma may choose to act kindly and help others because they believe their actions will have positive effects on their own life in the future or in future lifetimes. This moral framework can have a real and positive impact on individual behavior and society, demonstrating that karma serves a practical purpose beyond superstition. What you guys think? Should the concept of karma be rejected as another form of superstition or it may serve more as a profound philosophical idea that helps in boosting human morality and ethical behaviour?"

1966,"I'm a 38 year old man, and have been addicted to pornography for over 30 years (not a typo). 

It has been a battle but I can confidently say that this chain has been broken! 

If I can break free after 30 years, then I know you can too.


This is the process that helped me: 

1. Exposure

 Internal Exposure
Ask for forgiveness: Ask God for forgiveness, and forgive yourself. The past is in the past and today is a new day. Start with a clean slate.

Have faith: The lie that I believed was that I won't make it or I will be slave to this the rest of my life. It wasn't until I had faith that I can and will be free from it that I started having hope. I'm here to tell you that I have faith in you that you will be free from this; have faith in yourself as well. 


External Exposure 
Bring the addiction into the light: This one was hard for me because of the guilt and shame I had, but once I did I experienced a sense of relief like a baggage of weight was lifted off me. I found someone that I trusted and I came clean about the addiction I was fighting.

Get an accountability partner: after battling this on my own for decades (and failing), I got an accountability partner that could help me fight this battle. It was so much easier to break my addiction with someone in my corner helping and encouraging me. 

Be vulnerable: I did one of the hardest things and had an open conversation with the person who was affected by my addiction (my wife) and ask her to forgive me. This vulnerability helped save my marriage.

2. Rebuild yourself
Emotionally: after a clean slate and leaving the past in the past, I focused on improving my self worth and value. I started to verbally acknowledge truths of who I am in God, and as a man, even if I didn't believe it right away. 

Mentally: I focused on renewing my mind of what porn really is, and the harm it causes others. I also changed my view on what sex is and how quality of sexual intimacy is increased when done correctly. 

Physically: as a way of improving my self worth and value I started focusing on my health. Doing so helps fight against insecurities which led to caving to temptations. 

Spiritually: I studied about the armor of God (Ephesians 6) which is the spiritual key to resisting temptation. I took each quality and started learning what they mean and how I can apply them to my life.

3. Serve others: 
I started investing my time into people. I am serving in my church, and even now on reddit, to help others in various ways. To have a positive influence in someones life and be a blessing. 


I hope this helps you, please feel free to message me at any time. 


I have faith in you."
1967,"2 months ago it all rapidly clicked for me. Unfortunately, it took me 27 years, but I now believe in God—more specifically, I absolutely believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior and that He is God incarnate. 


I spent all 27 years of my life rejecting the idea of God ever existing and always thought religious people had religion as a crutch to cope with how meaningless and useless life is. The reality is that life without the belief in God is empty and void of meaning, but a life with religion and a personal relationship with God is beautiful.

My family is largely irreligious except for my mom who is an Orthodox Christian although even she isn't involved with any church. I still looked at most religions and the only one that truly makes sense to me is Christianity. I also think that Christianity is the truth because it is oddly the only religion that is actively undermined and suppressed by the powers that be. This made me start researching it more and things just....suddenly clicked and everything became clear to me.  

Never in a million years did I think that I would believe in God but here I am. Life comes at you fast and unexpectedly. God bless you all."
1970,"Let's say you have a child who's still dependant on you. And one day  they come home from school and announces *""mom.dad..I'm a Christian now""*. And then you see that they actually have been studying the Bible and believe the Genesis accounts of Creation, the flood, tower of Babel etc are meant to be understood literally. You try to debate them but they refuse to listen. 

How would you react? Would you accept them for who they are and be supportive? Or would you react harshly and talk them out of their newfound beliefs or try to de-convert them?"

I spent the majority of my life an atheist, i don't know if it was because I didn't believe, or that I didn't want the decision made for me. Either way, lately; this past year or 2. I've been feeling an urge to give my life to christ. I can feel it in my bones that there is a beautiful place of golden light he is beckoning me towards, but my flesh hesitates. 

Really what I'm wanting to ask what am I experiencing. I feel like I spent my life in the dark, now the light is on, I don't know what these things are called.  
What should I do?"
1980,"Hi there. So I’m still trying to figure ou Christianity. I was raised in it, but due to some “Christian” people in my life that have hurt me and some personal experiences I’m having trouble figuring out heaven, hell, salvation, everything like that.

So my questions, is it bad and sinful to like dark things? I like video games like cult of the lamb, bendy and the ink machine, doom, shows like helluva boss, and dark music. I really enjoy the dark, creepy atmosphere and the aesthetic of like dark magic, blood, and mysteriousness. I have an issue where I adopt feelings or attitudes in shows/music so I’m working on that. But I’m not becoming evil or satanic or anything, so I’m wondering if it’s ok for me to remain a true Christian while still enjoying media like that. My mom has said that it’s “demonic and has negative energy.” Honestly, I don’t even know what that really means. Like I’m not worshiping anything bad or endorsing evil, I just like the creepy and macabre.

I don’t want to have been sinning this whole time and end up going to hell for it. I’m not even sure if that’s how it works. Please help if anyone has insight or opinions on this

Examples of songs and things are “wool over our eyes” by the stupendium - it’s obviously talking about cultish things but I like the melody of the song and the theming and the artist isn’t truly talking about real demonic topics, is it bad and should I stop listening to it?"
1981,"Do we just preach to the ones who want to listen? Ignore the rest.... are the rest just in way too deep and we need to help pull them out or just leave them alone? Do we still help plant seeds of life for them? Do we preach if they strongly feel against it, and just ignore the ones ignoring us? Are they arguing as a cry for help unconsciously as in ""please prove me wrong"" or not?..."
1982,"I know that both days have meaning in the church but ever since I was little I was always astounded by the amount of people that came to my church on those days. I had never seen all the seats full and it was so weird to me. Now I am grown and honestly I still get confused by it. Ive talked to some of those people and they say “I am a Christian”. When they say this I am always confused. How can you claim to be Christian and only devote 2 days of the year in Church? Being lukewarm isnt going to save you in my opinion based on scripture. Now I have made some exceptions in my mind like maybe they have trauma or maybe they like to have a more personal relationship at home. For example they stay home and practice their own faith on Sundays etc. Point is I feel like majority dont do that though. It feels like a group of lukewarms going just to comfort themselves that they are living by God when they clearly are not. Now dont get me wrong I think it is great that they come and maybe itll help them take God more seriously, but it is just so puzzling to me that they choose to stay home the rest of the year. What do you guys think? Please be respectful. I understand their may be something I am missing or havent thought of so please bring it up in the replies. Have a blessed day 😊"
1983,"My whole world has been shook to my core recently. I married my college boyfriend who I met at church. We had much of our goals planned out as to how we wanted our family, where we would want to live.. everything else.
Ultimately, he developed a pretty bad drug habit and became unemployed for around a year and repeatedly denied my pleas to go go rehab. I initiated a divorce and worked it out so he could no longer use my/""our"" money to get high all day. Going through this process has led me down a spirally path, and I recently went out a few dates, which I didn't realize were dates, with a friend of a coworker who is a woman. I did not realize these were dates as I have never even considered being a lesbian and I was quite surprised when she told me her feelings for me. I have firmly believe homosexuality to be a sin, and I believe i'm on a downward spiral i to sin after getting divorced (something I have always believed to be sin as well, before going through the worst year of my life). I do not know what came over me but I let her stay the night at my house and she left in the morning. I have no ability to hid this from God, so saying it here means nothing: I am finding her attractive. I do not know if this is me being crazy and alone from the divorce, but she provides me so much comfort and compassion. I do not know what to do."
1984,"i’m considering going to church for the first time since i was a child this sunday, and i’m anxious because i’m not sure what to expect. walking into a situation where i don’t feel comfortable makes me really nervous. i want to go, but this is holding me back. any kind words or advice would be greatly appreciated"
1985,"Where in the Bible does it say specifically that Jesus is God?
Jesus may claim things such as believing in him will get you to heaven 
 also said no one goes to the father except through me but still doesnt claim to be God. God even calls Jesus his begotten son, and his son but never himself"
1987,"ever since my walk with god and stuff i have this overwhelming feeling of slavery. I cant stop thinking about life and death. i cant stop thinking about how god is constantly watching over me. i cant stop thinking about how i was only made on this earth to bow down to him. i feel trapped, i feel scared, i don't feel like a human. 

i have constant questions:
If god is living why does he allow bad things to happen? before you say ""it's because we live in a messed up world!"" i want you to think about the fact that god can control everything and he can choose to fix it. he can easily fix anything. so why is he not doing that? 

another thing is the reason that christ died. 
you are telling me god sacrificed himself, for himself, to save us from himself? that's insane! 

the last question i'll mention is:
god is omnipresent, we know this. we also know that god cant be in the presence of sin or hell. if thats the case, how does hell exist?

these questions were presented to me and they make so much sense. 
if god is loving, why do i feel at so much unease at the idea he is constantly watching me?

that's a huge thing for me right now, the idea of him watching me all the time freaks me out. when i'm showering, when i'm using the bathroom, when i'm outside, when i'm eating, all of those things i mentioned i'm being watched while doing. that's so uneasy. 

if anyone could help i'd appreciate it. much love to everyone!"
1988,"I’ve strayed from God so much. I suffer from depression and terrible anxiety, and I feel guilty that I can’t just trust in God and be happy with my life. This makes me turn from Him out of guilt and shame and I fall back into this toxic cycle of getting close to Him then running away out of shame. 

I’m 20 years old and most of the time I don’t see the purpose in life. I just want to be in Heaven now, so I don’t see the purpose in living life on Earth. That makes me feel guilty too, because God granted me the gift of life for a reason and I wish He never did. 

I know a lot of people will say it’s as simple as reading the word and praying but it doesn’t feel like enough. I’m consistent for a while then I feel shame and stop. I’m unworthy and don’t deserve all of the amazing things God has granted me. I take them for granted and question why I have them. 

I’ve only been saved for a few months now, but it feels like an uphill battle sometimes. I feel like I should have these answers and appreciate ite the life God has given me unconditionally but i just can’t. Please any advice with be amazing."
1989,"My girlfriend of almost a decade is an atheist. I have been walking with the lord for about 4 strong years and he is my #1. She has always said she “understands” and it’s clear that she thinks I’m a lunatic, and it truly breaks my heart to think that she hasn’t invited the lord into her life. I’m not sure if our goals for the future are similar, I would love to have a Christian wife and to teach our children about god but I think that would make my current partner angry if I even brought it up. I just need some of my fellow Christians to give me some guidance because the lord is telling me to reach out. Should I leave her and walk with god? Should I try to work it out? This relationship has pulled me away from my faith multiple times and I feel sometimes like letting her go may be the only option, though it is very hard due to the longevity and the memories we’ve shared. Thank you for reading."
1990,"The Jesus in the Bible went into the DARK TRENCHES and actually defended a prostitute and defended sinners. 

Jesus in the Bible once defended a prostitute by saying ""He who is without sin, cast the first stone. ""

Mark 9:10-17/ Mark 2:15-22/ Luke 5:29-39 - The Pharisee rebuke Jesus for eating with sinners, to which Jesus responds, ""it is not the healthy that need a doctor, but the sick ""

Jesus emphasis on MERCY as opposed to self righteousness judgement. 

TODAY, many Christians make Jesus seem like a he is better than everybody. Many Christians make Jesus seem mean, grumpy, and hell bent on sending sinners to hell when he is the total opposite. 

I love that version of Jesus better than the modern day Jesus that is portrayed in todays world."
1991,"Sorry English is my second language I apologize in advance. We focus too much on the slightest differences we have but we fail to realize the very big and most important thing we have in common. We all believe in the same god
Why are we focusing on such irrelevant details. We are all made to interpret things differently, we all may eat the same kind of foods but we all have a different sense of taste, I may like the taste of this drink and you may not, my ears perceive this music to be good and your ears perceive it in a way to be bad. This is what makes us special we all have different lenses in our eyes that perceive the world In front of us. That is what makes us unique and special , if we saw everything the exact same we would have no individuality and we would be robots. However! We all have ONE BIG THING IN COMMON…..  we believe in the lord JESUS CHRIST!  Why is that not enough to put down our differences and stop with this damn division! That is why Islam is growing so strong, because there isn’t all this bullshit with denominations and little differences being made such a big fuss about. Who cares if you like to pray on your knees, sitting down, if you like to sing, or perhaps you interpret a scripture slightly differently. Maybe you like statues and perhaps you don’t like statues….. who cares we are stronger together and this isn’t what Jesus wanted, the masses want us to be divided because when we are united we are at our most powerful. But we are taught to celebrate and focus on important details so we lose our power and the people behind close doors can profit on it and control us. Christians please unite we all believe in the lord and saviour Jesus that’s enough. Stop trying to control one another, I don’t care what denomination you are let’s just unite… or suffer the reality of Islam being the biggest religion in the world."

= a scam

If you are a Christian on social media you are more likely to be targeted by them and they don't start of by asking for money I saw someone on a Christian subreddit someone had showed me there messages and all I had listened above matched 

They know Christians are more likely to be donate or be guilted, but don't they actually beat up kids for the pictures they use to prove things 

I got one of these guys and even though I'm a minor and had only 50 bucks and no job I was trying to give either I'm gullible or they are super good anyways watch out and don't give them your money I did alot of research and these guys are greedy and not helping there community

Edit: for mods, I'd also like to say to the mods these pepole on redit usually have low effort posts that are down

1996,"I also have not instantly become a servant of the Antichrist, nor have I suddenly become brainwashed. I’m still 100% fine. 

Maybe people should cool it with the end of the world/mark of the beast predictions, given that they’ve never been right and even Christ Himself said “no one can know the hour or the day.”

This is just the latest in a series of events that people are claiming to usher in the apocalypse. Not ONE of the thousands of historical predictions has proven true, and these kinds of hyperbolic fearmongering only serves to make people take Christianity less seriously. 

Jesus said we won’t know the hour or the day. These conspiracy theories have infiltrated Christian circles and only make Christianity a laughingstock and accomplishes nothing useful or good.

Edit: this was not meant to be political. It was supposed to be mostly humorous while reminding everyone that if there’s hype about the end of the world, it’s probably not true. 

If you are personally offended by this, I can only imagine why. Obviously I’m not saying you have to have the vaccine to be saved. You can have it or not and still be saved and physically fine. I do personally think it’s a good idea to get it if you can but there are plenty of legitimate reasons to choose not to. “It injects nanobots activated by mobile signal” is not one of them. I had hoped we could all acknowledge it’s not. But I’ve gotten several comments acting like I’m the Antichrist for being pro vaccine. 

If one political party buys into conspiracy theories more than the others, that’s not my fault and you’re the one reading between the lines. Maybe ask yourself why and stop picking on me. 

Get the vax or don’t. Be afraid of 5g or microchips or whatever, or don’t. But no one is dying en masse from the vaccine, no one got turned into a zombie, some nebulous cartoonishly evil cabal is not out to get you, and you don’t have to be afraid of everything. 

God didn’t give us a spirit of fear. He gave us a reasonable faith and reasonable brains. He created a world of physical order. Science is a thing. The universe was created with certain rules we’ve been able to figure out. Science isn’t evil. I can’t believe I had to make this edit.

Edit 2: a lot of y’all getting reported for breaking the COVID policy rule. Don’t hate the player hate the game.

I’m not even sorry for reporting people for breaking the rules of this sub. You should be ashamed of yourselves spreading lies and nonsense that hurts people."
1997,"Sometimes it just comes to me randomly, i was cleaning my room and i did, i was on discord last weekend and it did during a call i started crying on call.

2001,"Soooo my aunt is staying over at my/my parents house and shes staying in my room. I, ofc like many other teenagers my age, have posters in my room. She complained to my parents about my one piece poster and how it's negative and it has nothing to do with God so I had to take it down. I didn't want to but not my parents are making me take it down because they favor her over me. She was giving me a lecture about how if it's not related to God then its negative and I should have more God related things instead of that. She brings God into everythinggg so I knew it was gonna be a long lecture and interrupted her and said I would take it down and walked away. I'm so angry right now because its just a poster?? its fiction?? I told her that the poster just shows them wanting to reach their goals and how thats a positive things but she really doesn't care, whether im right or not its whatever she says goes. I need advice on how to deal with her?? My parents listen to her all the time and now she's treating me like I did something wrong just because I have a poster of something that I love in my room??? Everytime she brings up God to justify her every action is making me more and more angry at her and God. I know its not God's fault obviously but I have been trying to get closer to God and her using God for her own actions is not helping..."
2002,"""*Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?*""

I feel the most valuable thing a person can do is to let go, leave things to God.  This is something that contemplative prayer is centered around, letting go in silence so as to find union with God.

However, it seems like alot of the time, people view their relationship with God less in terms of letting go and accepting what is given and more in terms of asking for what they want, asking for their worldly desires to be satiated.

Do you see this dichotomy arise as frequently as I do?  Do you think there should be more emphasis placed on letting go and trusting God?"
2003,"When we are suffering, our faith is being tested. So the adversary comes to see if he can devour you. To see if he can get you to trust your circumstances over God’s word & thus get you to renounce your faith! That’s why the Bible says that the enemy comes to steal, kill & destroy. He’s always causing afflictions in people’s lives to get them to doubt God just bc they are suffering. When God says in His word that the promises are ours no matter what!  God is not mad at you or punishing you bc of what you’re going through, the enemy is at work in your life to get you to fall for it, but it’s a test! In which God is supplying you with all that’s needed to get you through it & is working it out for your good. The end result = stronger faith! While the enemy is trying to destroy your faith, God is using it to build up your faith! So don’t be ignorant of the schemes of the devil; stand strong! 💪🏻"
2004,"ive been wanting to tattoo a verse on me   
(got the idea from Jon Jones)  
mainly psalm 118:6  
but when you look it up it has different translations(?) i should say, for example :  


The Lord is on my side; I will not be afraid   
The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?   
 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do to me?   


i know they have the same meaning but which is the most ""correct"" one  
thank you"
2006,"There are several people who are interested in the responses to this post.

The LORD has blessed me to be in a position where I can move anywhere in the world that I want to.  I am considering moving to another country.  I've been to this country enough that I feel comfortable being there.  However, I am considering moving due to some reasons that I am certain some of you who read this post may find ridiculous.  This assumption is not because I think its ridiculous at all, but I noticed that most people dont take any conversations about this seriously.  Or worse, they get upset and judge me for it.  

I have recently married a wonderful christian woman from abroad, and she is able to tell that there is something wrong with the way people behave around me and my siblings.  She doesnt understand it because noone does this kind of stuff in her country and it makes her upset.  

After having traveled the world enough now, I have realized that I cannot and have never felt comfortable in the United States.  I didn't realize that the way I was feeling was abnormal until I traveled for the first time.  This next sentence is where I am probably going to lose anyone reading this post so honestly I am hesitant to mention it, but its necessary 

I am a half black and half white male in his early 30s.  

I honestly dont leave my home for any reason except to travel or for provisions.  I dont feel comfortable being seen anywhere here and never have.  My 8 brothers and sisters are also half black and half white and they all feel the same way.  I do my best to make sure they dont have to leave their homes.  

MOST not all, people are not violent towards us, however we can just feel how much we are judged by everybody here.  

Specifically I am tired of being stared at EVERYWHERE I go in the united states.  I never have this problem abroad, only here in the u.s..  I am tired of being stared at like some kind of zoo animal all the time.

  
It also has always seemed that we are looked at as the source of all this nations problems.  My assumption is, the ""woke"" stuff is out of control, so now our country is getting ready to pivot to a more conservative stance on everything and anyone who is seen as standing out will be targeted.  

But here is the problem I am facing, I CANNOT CHANGE MY SKIN.  Therefore I cant help but to stand out.  So I am automatically lumped into all this ""woke"" stuff.  I am a conservative christian.  

I am tired of being challenged for no reason.  Its not comfortable to always be challenged when you are just trying to be quiet and stay out of the way.

I am tired of being treated as arrogant when I am in a good mood, and psychotic when I am in a normal or unhappy mood.  This again is not a problem I have ever had abroad and every half black / half white person I have ever known in the U.S. has had this same experience.  I guess Michael Jackson, prince, chris brown, the island boys, takashi 69 and andrew and tristan tate have created a label for us.

My wife is tired of the way people behave around me and is constantly telling me how much better it would be for me and my siblings to move to any of the other places we've been.  She is disgusted with the way Americans have treated me and my siblings.  So I have pressure in this sense to leave as well.

Its not fair that my siblings and I are being seen in such a negative light.  If we could we would have changed our skin a long time ago, but we just cant.

I feel sorry for my siblings because I will be leaving them behind and they will have to be exposed to the racism and disgust on a much more constant basis without me there.  I am conflicted between leaving them here or staying to protect them.  

Any advice would be helpful.  "
2007,"**Luke 10:13-16**

13 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. 14 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you. 15 And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades. 16 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.

\[Commentary\]

If you will recall, in yesterdays lesson we looked at Luke 10:1-12, a passage that explains how Jesus picked 70 of his followers to go out and evangelize throughout the region.  Jesus gives them instructions  including how to handle towns that do not receive them (v. 10-12).  In today’s lesson it would seem that  it naturally brought to his mind the sad state and punishment of the cities where he himself had preached most frequently, namely, Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. 

For, notwithstanding he had often resided in those cities, and performed many miracles before the inhabitants of them, they had continued impenitent.  Because he was never to preach to them any more, and because he knew how great their punishment would be, in the overflowing tenderness of his soul he affectionately lamented their obstinacy, which he foresaw would draw down on them the heaviest judgments.  

The same declaration Christ had made some time before. By repeating it now he warns the seventy not to lose time by going to those cities.

Finally he told them that, whoever rejected them—the seventy—also rejected him.  Jesus said, “Whoever rejects me, rejects he who sent me.”  How his heart must ache, for the multitudes that will suffer the consequences for rejecting him.   

Let us strive to not be among that number who he weeps for."
2008,"Why do we treat the Bible like it's a math formula? This is how rules are formed, and they rarely honor the original context. Pull a thread and it begins to unravel. But the Bible offers us so much more than this."
2010,I like to read my bible at my desk when I’m on break at work. It has gotten me through many rough days. My coworkers have been making comments saying it’s “weird” and asking me why I’m reading it. I guess I don’t look like a typical Christian. But they are making me feel bad and like it’s something that should be kept private when it’s not. Any advice? Is this religious discrimination or should I just ignore the comments?

2014,"I was diagnosed with ESRD, end stage renal disease more than a year ago. Both of my kidneys were failing and I had to be in dialysis. I was able to get a kidney transplant in a short amount of time because of my age, health and my blood type. It's ironic given my username but I don't know if I am grateful. 

I'm doing okay, I'm working on a diet and I'm starting to exercise. I want to provide for my family and the needy as a way to honor God and make the donor and her family proud. I don't know if I'm ignorant or if I accept my fate easily. I realize the situation was dangerous, I could've died but God allowed me to receive a transplant. I started to change after I became a believer but I can't help but think that it was a warning from God. 

It's even more of a problem because of my addiction, I've chosen to do it more than once and even though I've been able to stop some old habits, sin is equal. I wouldn't be surprised if I get diagnosed with an acute rejection and I go to hell. I'm freaking out!"

As long as we rely on Him wholeheartedly, He will definitely help us."
2017,Exactly! I feel like fundamentalist Christians minimize and depersonalize God and stuff him into the confines of the Bible just because that's easier for them in the black and white thinking that they desire. But that is not the truth of God. You can't fit God inside of a book.
2018,"This may sound dumb but hear me out, please. For a while, I've been thinking about my future. I think about where I could be a year from now. I think about how I'm going to be able to provide for the needy, whether I'm going to try to improve the relationship that I have with God, if I'm going to have the same job, etc. I'm rushing because I'm desperate. 

I can't help but think that God is going to kill me because of what I've done. I can't think about my future a lot because I get a feeling that I'm not going to live for that long. I don't know, it would be nice to make a plan for my life but I can't stop that feeling of impending doom. I'm evil, I'm addicted to pornography and it's starting to become a habitual sin. Doesn't God kill evil people? Maybe that is the reason as to why I feel that way?"
2019,"I’m a recovering addict. I used to be addicted to heroin and fentanyl and meth. Now I’m addicted to weed and kratom. I CANNOT describe the feeling I have when I’m not on drugs. It feels like EVERYTHING is wrong and I just want to die. I have intrusive thoughts telling me to worship satan and just to fu*king kill myself. Images of me hanging from a rafter or blowing my brains out seem so peaceful to me. I’m tormented day and night. Sometimes I have moments where I’m too busy to focus on them, but at night they keep me up, unless I smoke weed or take kratom. I really believe in God and I love Jesus, I just feel like maybe I’m supposed to go to hell. I don’t and never have felt any love from Jesus, and that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him and what he does for people it’s just the truth. What God has done for others he hasn’t done for me. And I’m suffering beyond what I can explain. And I try to talk to my family about recently because it really feels like it’s not my thoughts any more, like maybe I have a mental illness. But they tell me I’m having a pity party and I just need to change my perspective and pray, and then they all avoid me because it’s like walking on eggshells around me or it’s depressing to deal with I’m sure. But I’m still here and my perspective doesn’t change. Sometimes it does and I’m super hungry to find out more about God, then sometimes it’s like I’m physically drained and I just want to die and it’s everything I can do to pick up a Bible and when I do it’s almost like I have dyslexia or I can’t even focus.

2021,"Im having a personal struggle recently with the ol ""tackle tugging"" addiction and no matter what I do I cant seem to stop. When I try to not do it I just get more and more tempted until I eventually give in. And I pray for forgiveness and for the strength to stop doing it but unfortunately it goes unanswered. The hard part is I keep praying for forgiveness but God says that praying for forgiveness for a sin and then doing it again is like a direct insult to Him. Any advice? I genuinely don't know what to do."

2023,"How do you handle them? I just gave someone 5€ who was asking for food and showed people his hat, hoping they’d put money in. Normally I should feel good since I helped out a person in need but I always have the fear that they’re lying as we don’t know if they’re really poor or whether they’ll really buy food. Also, in the Bible it says that one shouldn’t be seeking admiration from others when giving to the needy. However, it was in public, am I supposed to lure him into a dark alley so no one sees us? (Refer to Matthew 6, 1-4)"

2028,"I’m not trying to be rude, as a Catholic I’m asking respectfully. This argument is one I’ve never understood. Jesus talks about people who do not do things for others, and how those who do not do things for others did not do those things for God. He says not all who say Lord Lord shall make it into Heaven. And obviously there’s the Faith without works is dead. Outside of that, it doesn’t seem logical at all. Judas believed in Jesus, was he saved? If a mass murderer died unrepentant for his sins, but believed in Christ, would he be saved? Many people bring up the Ephesians 2 verse, but that doesn’t confirm faith alone, rather that Jesus died for our sins, and works alone aren’t enough, which no Christian will deny. Some say that not believing in faith alone diminishes Jesus’ sacrifice, but I have always felt the idea diminishes a bit his teachings. If anyone can get to Heaven by faith alone, than that would mean God’s commandments are a common courtesy rather than a necessity. I have always felt that faith + love for Jesus gets us to Heaven. Faith affirms Christ’s sacrifice, and love affirms our faith. Jesus says “If you love me, follow my commandments”, what do you think?"
2029,"I'm 15, I've been Christian my whole life, and I've gotten down to thinking about things, and I feel like there is definitely a God, no doubt, but I have doubts about a Christian one, and the complexities of an after life..                         My parents recently got a legal separation which led to a divorce and my dad blamed it all on me and I left, I lived with my sister until I worked things out with my mom, but I'm just wondering, why would God do this to me if he's all rightous? Ik I probably sound so lost and deceived, but I just feel like I'm tired of devoting so much time and effort into something idk is even real. I just feel like everything I've made is all crashing down"

2032,"My walk with Jesus is new. God has been slowly throughout the years convicting me of certain things and what I know now, I can’t go back. I can only further my walk, I can’t deny the truth anymore. I feel stuck now with how I used to do things vs how I should do things now. 

My question is, how do I give advice now? I find myself stuck now in a way I’ve never felt stuck before. I used to be able to give advice so easily. Now, I stop and think about God before saying anything. If it’s not in alignment with him, I don’t even want to say it. Its funny because when I did a bible study with a Jehovah witness for a little bit (I stopped because I felt God did not want me to do that) I would ask for advice and she would bring up scriptures. I would get so annoyed and think “why can’t she just tell me what SHE FEELS about it” that was two years ago and it all make sense now. 

I have no idea what to say to a friend who doesn’t believe in Jesus. I respect her beliefs and I don’t push anything on anyone.

 But she and her husband are going through something. She asked him for an open relationship and he agreed to it. He saw her texting a man and he broke down and couldn’t take it (even though he has done certain unfaithful things. She told me she feels bad but it’s annoying that he can do whatever he wants. She told me the guy she’s texting is her delivery guy and when he delivers something he was flirty and the next day she went to Pilates, he happened to be there too and she thought it was a sign to get his number. 

She wants a divorce and  I was going to say to her “do what your heart tells you” BUT, how can I say that when that’s not what I feel for myself? I would go to God. It didn’t  feel right to say. Scriptures pop in my mind, I say to myself “this is why God is important in marriage” but I can’t say that because when I mentioned that before regarding my own relationship having God centered, she said “idk what that means because me and my husband don’t believe in that” so I know I can’t give Godly advice. Idk what to do. I pray for their marriage but I don’t know how to speak anymore. I ended up telling her “I hope it works out in the end for everyone” I even said “why is he upset if he has done unfaithful things too?” Those were my own feelings because I really don’t like cheating. I shouldn’t have said that. 

And The first thing I said to myself when she said it was a sign was,  “A sign from who!?” God will not lead you to cheat on your husband so where is the sign from? It was a challenging interaction for me. Everything in my life that is happening, God is my first thought. Is that normal? 

Any advice ? How can I honor God without putting my own beliefs on someone?"
2033,"I’ve found most apologists to be terrible. I don’t think they’re bad Christians or corrupt, but I find their arguments to be tiresome regurgitations of arguments that have been regularly defeated. In fairness I think they’re trying to actually address doubts and questions Christians have and bolster their confidence in the faith, not to witness to atheists. 

I’ve already listened to most popular apologists and watched debates they’ve had with atheists. I find myself agreeing more with the atheists than the Christian."
2034,Well I would like to thank all the good comments. My walk with god is hard and right now I don't see the road back. I feel like I don't deserve life or even my creator. I feel like such a mistake. I was better off being aborted as a baby. If I died I'm sorry for everything god I could've done better but I don't know how to even change. I was the only mistake God has ever made. I'm genuinely sorry but I know that doesn't matter to you god because you hate me and cannot wait to release your wrath on me. Whatever you do I'll take it. All of you guys deserve his goodness not me. The only goodness in me is my skeleton dead in the soil.

2039,"Got married last year, I (30,F) rushed into marriage because I my husband (31,M) was gentle, soft spoken, well educated  me and took good care of his Dad. It was an arranged match( happens in this part of the world). We are in early 30s.  Most of courtship was over video calls as we were working in different cities.


 I attributed some of his akward behaviors to shyness.I realized a day before the wedding that he was previously in a live in relationship with his last girlfriend. I thought they had just dated casually.He had invited her and her parents to the wedding without letting me know. On the day of the wedding, on the way from the church to the reception, he was chatting about the wedding with a female relative on his mobile, till she told him to focus on enjoying the wedding. 

On our honeymoon,  he would go and wave at random people especially ladies and give a random flying kiss to people serving at restaurant. He said he didn't mind me migrating to a different country to work. He was very slow in renovating our flat. I tried to help but he would not let me throw old, rotted furniture. So we had to stay in his brother's place till it was ready.He would pull his twin brother's wife's cheeks and say she is like his sister. He would always go to his twin's brother and cuddle his twin brother smooching him repeatedly all over his face 100s of times. I told him I was uncomfortable with all this as I don't understand it and he then stopped it. He spent most of his time with his dad who stayed across the road as he worked from home and kept all his stuff in his dad's place. Father cannot walk because of wound in the leg, so I was okay with him taking care of him. But he wouldn't return till 12pm in the night or keep going to and fro between residences. He encouraged me to work two jobs to earn extra but when I told him he wasn't spending time with me, he said it was because of my job. But he would not spend Sundays with me and expect me to spend with his dad. He would always last an hour in bed and say the men in his family are great in bed. He would not throwaway garbage boxes in our house for weeks nor let me , because he wanted money from recyclable items. He would get up at 8 in the morning and straight away go to his Dad's and help him and sleep till his office began. Evenings he spent hours chatting with his twin and sister and say I'm not social. Sometimes,  I felt he would attempt to spend more time with me but go back to the old ways.

I started having anger outbursts and crying all the time because I felt resentful he had married me just out of curiosity and took me for a joke. 
We started fighting,  went to a therapist. He told the therapist I was yelling. Therapist said that he was triggering me. Told me I should stay separately for sometime as I had lost weight and was very sad from the stress. Then I accidentally found out my sister in law was sending him articles on my anger outbursts. He said it was because I had an outburst in front of them. Finally we had a very big fight when he returned home at 1pm one day and I said things in anger. For the first time,  he got angry instead of being indifferent. He asked my dad to take me home for some time. I went home for a week, returned ( not home but a separate place)and called him to meet to discuss us. He said I could come home and I said I'll work on not reacting in anger. I said I'll stay separately for a month or two to regain my health and we would frequently meet and sort issues. He refused therapy saying I didn't improve the first time. He would not pick up my call or respond to my text after the meeting. But every 10 days he would abruptly message to meet. If I made a plan he would refuse citing work so I would meet whenever it was convenient for him. I clearly asked him if he wanted to reconcile and he said we are doing this to reconcile, but he cannot change and take responsibilities. If he likes a midnight bath for an hour I have to accept it and I should socialize with the sister in law. He said it's all my fault and I have to work on my anger. I did not say much as I didn't want to fight. He stopped communicating totally after meeting thrice and saying we are working towards reconciliation. I stopped from my end as I felt he was doing this purposely. He then changed his profile to partying with his twin and sister in law.

Two months later, after no contact my dad went to his house and his dad eagerly announced that we should separate quickly and get a cheap lawyer. My husband refused to come out of the room for a long time.He said my husband can't take stress and gets startled easily. After being coaxed by his brother, my husband came out and started blaming me for this situation and said he agreed with his dad.

 Tl;dr-I feel I couldn't save this short , troubled marriage and  have failed. I guess I'll never have closure on why he agreed for reconciliation when he just wanted separation.I always thought I'll improve on my part of handling the relationship but he didn't want to give it even a single chance. Feel very guilty at my contribution to this downfall. God intended marriage to be a covenant and I failed to keep up with it."
2041,I've messed up too much and they say god loves us no matter what but I feel that I'm the only exception. My sins are greater than th tallest mountain. No way God can love me anymore. I can't even ask for forgiveness because I'm just a disappointment. A mistake. And nothing more. God genuine you made a mistake creating me. All I do is screw up. Their is nothing good about me.

2043,"After attending a few streams online, I decided I wanted to actually go to a campus location so I can atleast know where to go this Sunday for morning service.. after a 30 minute drive to the location, I sat in the parking lot for 10 minutes never going inside then drove away..

Still wanting to go to service Sunday morning, also want to get to the point that my 3 year old can attend their kids service.

Social anxiety can be crippling. Days leading up to today I was excited, even thrilled at the thought but now that I didn’t follow through I am feeling like an utter failure.

2045,"This is obviously an awkward topic to talk about, so I'll try to be blunt and quick. 

I'm 30 years old, and I'm still a virgin. I'm not going to pretend I'm some bastion of chastity, I'm not, but Ive tried to remain a virgin until I'm married, and Honestly I'm tired of it. By 30, almost everyone who has ever lived has had sex by this point in their life, its a normal part of the human experience that I just haven't gotten to have. I want to have it, I want to be close with someone like that. Ive struggled and struggled and struggled against lust but almost always lose. I almost always end up back where I started, watching stuff I probably shouldn't, or going through a phase where I read ""christian"" erotica sites and try to defend my behavior. 

I feel like I'm just horrible hopeless person who will never have healthy connections with others. Ive done 12 steps, therapy, ect. My whole adult life has been devoted to self improvement and growth, but the fact is that I'm poor, physically ill, and that makes it really hard to have a steady job and connect with others. 

Maybe I'm just a bad person and this is all I'll ever be. Maybe I should just accept that I'll always have lust in me and I Can't beat it, no amount of prayer has helped. ""Give it to god"" has never worked. I'm tired. I'm tired of doing all the things I'm suppose to be doing, society told me to do, church people told me to do, and its never enough. 

On the outside I'm a mature, responsible person, but on the inside I'm a mess and I fear I""m just not enough. Not for friendship, much less romantic involvement. I'm not a ""niceguy"", I don't do things because I expect something in return. I managed to avoid a lot of the toxic ""pill"" type traps that seem to be aimed at people like me. I wish I could just have a friend who was my friend, knowing I struggle with stuff, and would just accept me, but I can't actually open up to anyone cause people kinda stay at arms distance. Maybe I keep them there."
2046,"I’m labeling this as satire, because it makes this post come off as more lighthearted. But anyways, I hear what some Christians think, believe and preach, that from my perspective is ridiculous and pathetic.

Like people believe a perfectly loving God WILL condemn finite humans (made in his image) to hell for all of eternity, to be tormented unendingly.

Or Christians who worry about COVID or Crypto being related to the anti-Christ, when really they shouldn’t worry but instead trust in the Lord their God. Maybe they can’t trust their God. Maybe I don’t believe in the same Christian God as they do. I believe in the God of Romans 8, in which no principality or power can stand against those who believe and confide in. These people who worry and fear the anti-Christ must believe in some weaker god, who cannot be trusted or confided in. And one who desires for them to worry unneedlessly.

Then there’s Christians who preach Halloween and Christmas are Pagan holidays, and we absolutely should not celebrate them. But then those same Christians make practice of the terms Sunday-Saturday, even when confronted with the knowledge that such terms are pagan and nature. Therefore proving that such a belief upheld by them is utterly vain and that the only reason they don’t do Halloween and Christmas, isn’t because those have pagan origins, but because they are lead to believe these things not by the spirit of God but by delusion.

I could go on and on. I’m not perfect, none of us are. We are only made righteous through Christ. But the stuff I hear other Christians think, believe and preach, genuinely makes me think less of them in regards to the accuracy of whatever beliefs they might have. Like why else should I give any weight to anything else they might preach, if their other thoughts are anchored by delusion? Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe I’m right. Maybe I’m arrogant, but maybe I’m just a little better at discerning this sorta thing than these people are. Lmfao"

I’ve been attempting to change my hyper-sexual behavior over the last few weeks and it’s been a struggle for sure. It seems like I’m being assaulted with very aggressive, intrusive sexual thoughts and the harder I fight them, the more aggressive they get. These thoughts are mostly replays of past actions. Memories of old flings. I try to pray through them and eventually that works but they get so bad sometimes. I don’t know if this is normal or if you have some other way to get rid of them and keep them away. I feel like sometimes I’m on the very edge of falling back into immorality.

2054,"I grew up in a loosely religious house to the point where it was rarely brought up.

The only explanation I have is there is a God now I've stop questioning and am trying to explore Christianity. I guess people I used to agree with could say I've been tricked or manipulated into a ""cult"" which I disagree with and even if it's true I ""manipulated"" myself because it's the way where life makes sense and at least I have faith in life and think we're not just one big ""chance"" and ""not important""

But I just have a driving urge to help those who need it- and I don’t see why the government doing that is problematic. Most Christian’s I know are very much staunch capitalists- many voted for Trump. And many still support Trump. Granted this is my *personal* experience. But it just doesn’t make sense to me. I always considered myself to be a social conservative in the sense of opposing abortion. Anyway it just doesn’t make sense to me- how did the Republican Party win the evangelical vote?

A while back, I thought that God offered me a deal. That if I don’t sin (a specific sin) he will protect my nephew but if I do the sin he will kill my nephew. I felt bound to the offer and kept it. I have an OCD. Is it intentional if I willingly accepted the promise bc I wanted my nephew to be protected, I didn’t want him to die so I knew since God was offering this to me i couldn’t sin. Also, if I have sex God will give me HIV. I don’t want HIV so I’ve accepted I can’t have sex. I have an OCD, if I willingly accepted and got into a situation ( because of my ocd and I didn’t realize at the time it was my ocd) does that seem intentional to you? Or does it seem like I would be bound to it? Again I did accept the promise because I felt like I said to, because I was afraid of the consequences that we’re attached to it. These happened bc of my ocd but I still accepted it. 
I really wanted my nephew protected, so I told myself I couldn’t do that specific sin. I’m just worried if he will die and if I will get HIV if I ever have sex in the future.

Edit: do you guys think it is within God’s character, for these days, to kill someone as a result of a broken promise anyway?

It feels Iike the initial promises didn’t come from me but my OCD formed these threats, so I accepted that I could no longer do a certain sin or have sex in the future. I accepted it because if I did these things, bad things would happen."
2059,"Hi all,

For some context- I just started dating a really lovely guy online. 

He used to be Catholic and had some trauma there- so when I told him about myself and Christianity he is supportive but hesitant himself. We've had some great talks and some agreements on Christianity too.

That being said I'm genuinely... scared. i will say that I have fallen to masturbation a lot because of this relationship. We love each other very much and being so far away is hard. But I go to great lengths to show him I love him, and I genuinely do. He has fulfilled alot of my expectations for a man and heck, we've even talked about marriage and our futures and such. SO, everything's going great...

&#x200B;

but I still feel... guilty. I've told him I need to distance myself from masturbation for spiritual reasons, and the fact I had an addiction in the past. It goes great until I fall into the temptation again. He's so sweet and helpful and I feel he genuinely cares. We like all the same things...

I love him so much and I don't want to break up with him. But this tug-of-war with this guilt in my soul is a lot and I feel I'm letting God down. Then again the devil may just be lying to me to make me feel bad.  But I remember a Billy Graham sermon. ""The price to pay for following Christ is everything. What would you give up to follow Christ? Would you break up with your boyfriend if he interferes with your walk with God?""

What do I do? I'm so so scared to approach him with this... I just... I feel terrible either way. I can't break up with him, I can't... I just feel so bad... I love him, of course, I love God more than anything. but I pray and pray and I must being ignoring the obvious or maybe God supports this. i just don't know."
2062,"Then explain how I could fall in love with a person I haven't seen in years? We are long distance friends since she moved away years ago. 

I literally can't remember what she looks like minus hair color and basic things like that. 

But I am so freaking in love with her. Not for her body. But her person. I'm in love with HER, not her body. She makes me feel feelings I have never felt before. I am so in love with her, it hurts so bad. I can't even listen to music without thinking of her. 

So I don't understand how people can say I just need to work on my lust problem when I literally have nothing to lust on. 

She means so much to me and I cry myself to sleep at night knowing I can neve be with her and that one day she'll get married and have a husband and I will no longer be the closest person in her life. 

I try to keep my feelings at bay by remembering that she is someone's future wife. I wouldn't go after a married woman so I'm not going to go after a woman who won't marry me. It's basically the same thing. She can't be mine. No matter how much that hurts me. 

Anyways, I just don't get it lol. 

It's not hypersexual lust, it's not trauma, it isn't a lack of praying. 

Idk what to do."
2063,"And it seems to be doing the same to a lot of other people. 

I mean, how many posts on ""is this allowed"", ""is it a sin to"", ""will God hate me if"", ""Will God forgive me if"", etc do you see on a daily basis

Way too many. 

Its sad really. It's hard for me to imagine that God could possibly make His love so complicated. He wants us to love him and yet he makes so many rules and threatens people to eternal suffering if they make a mistake. 

People can say that Jesus stops that. But does he really if we still have to follow the rules even after that? Like what's the point of calling it a gift if we still have to do something to earn it? That's like your boss saying that your paycheck is a gift. Sure, without them you wouldn't get the money but you still had to earn it. 

It's just all so complicated. Like I have to be celibate for the rest of my life because God doesn't want me to marry another woman. 

And if God was truly good, why have so many terrible things happened in his name? 

It just makes no sense to me. 

I truly believe that there is a God out there. And tbh, I think what scares me most is there there is a chance that God really is as scary as I see him and there is nothing any of us could do about. People always say they couldn't worship a God like this but do we even have a choice? Like God could be evil and we'd have no choice but to follow him. You see what I'm saying? We are powerless. 

Sometimes that also makes me wonder if all religion is false because the statistical odds of having a God be good or evil is roughly 50/50, assuming there is one. And yet all of them are good God's. But technically there could be an evil God and we'd be stuck like that. 

Anyways, I need some help. I feel like this is just becoming really complicated. All I want is to have the joy I see other Christians have. It's not fair."
2064,"I was raised in the Baptist Church. We had mothers day out. We also had day child care services for kids during service. As I became older I parted from the Baptist church and began to attend non denominational churches. Again child care was provided for those services as well.

My husband and I began to long for something with tradition again. I was afraid of losing community but we ultimately ended up finding this great Lutheran Church ( my husband is Lutheran ) and we joined.

We love children. And believe that they should be involved in the church. We understand that toddlers and babies are going to cry, and wiggle - and do infant/toddler things. However, they're some children who are screaming. Who are climbing on the pews. Climbing on the floors. Throwing their toys around and disrupting the service. These parents just let them do it and don't even try to take them to the quiet room in the back. This has happened at nearly every service we've been to since attending. I can't tell you a sermon I've remembered due to this noise. I find it disrespectful towards the church. Esp the allowing the kids to treat the church like an amusement park and having them literally standing and climbing on the pews during the sermon.

We decided that we wanted to bring this issue up with our assigned elder. The conversation didn't really go to plan. It seemed the elder took it as we were suggesting that kids shouldn't be apart of church. I tried to explain there's a difference between wiggles/crys/woos etc. and disrespect of the church. I don't think he was getting it, and went as far as ""well some kids have autism"" REALLY lol. We would never suggest that a child with special needs should be taken out of the church, and of course they would be the exception to the rule. They believe that toddlers and babies even though they can't speak benefit from the sermons and even understand them ( I find that a little woo woo but ok ).

Are we out of line here. We left the conversation with the elder giving us podcasts to listen to and verses to look up. He did say he will bring the issue up with the other elders to see how they can find a balance. But we both left the conversation wishing that we didn't bring this up and almost as if we did something wrong. Like bringing up a concern to a parent and getting scolded for it. It was strange. I don't feel like we were in the wrong here. We know other members feel the same, we are just the ones who happen to speak up."
2066,"I know this may sound ignorant or something, but I’ve recently been enjoying starfield, and I was playing this one mission where I was infiltrating some gangs’ hideout and it just exploded into non stop violence for like 10 mins. I’m a pretty veteran player and I’m not new to violence. But I just sat there for a second and realized, im literally just gunning these dudes down without a single thought, I know their like not real, but at a certain point it go to another level and I felt sick so I just turned off the game and haven’t played in awhile. This is the first time this has happened in years and years of non stop gaming. Recently a few months ago I came to the lord maybe he’s opening my eyes to something I’ve been so blind to in the past. I don’t want to sound like an old man but maybe all this violence in video games aren’t good for any of us. Also, you can steal ships and do all kinds of stuff I wouldn’t do in real life, do you think the actions we take in video games count as sins?"
2067,"So if the body of Christ where to be divided are we to some how heal divisions? How do we heal divisions?

What causes divisions?

1 Corinthians 12:3

3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.

(The question I also have is what happens if multiple many different denominations say the specific words of “Jesus is Lord” does this mean the Holy Spirit can reside in multiple denominations?)

I’ve observed over the years many denominations say these words? It seems when I look up sermons on this topic Pastors and believers go into the “Body of Christ” in the sense of there own Church congregations or denominations and buildings which I agree with but what many shy away from talking about is what about beyond the Church walls? What about other denominations are they apart of the Body of Christ?

Do you think God is somehow using different denominations for some ultimate purpose or plan?

1 Corinthians 12 ESV

1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. 2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is accursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit. 4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; 5 and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; 6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. 7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills. 12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit. 14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many. 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, 25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together. 27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way."

Sunday school, cross training, confirmation the whole kit and caboodle. I went to a very accepting church.

He’s a dick! He sends people to hell just because they don’t praise him and “went away from his love”. 
According to the bible god has done some truly awful things simply because people didn’t praise him. I just can’t see how that is at all loving. God seems cruel and almost evil.

Although I know that, as a Christian, one must attend church gatherings and read God’s words, and I want to practice in accordance with God’s requirements, my work is so busy every day at the moment and I have an active social life. I feel exhausted every day. Although I’ve made some money over the past few years and my living standards have improved, I always feel like I want to make more money in order to provide protection for my family’s future. Therefore, I work very hard every day to make money and I have no time to attend church gatherings or read God’s words. My heart always feels empty and I feel indebted to the Lord. How can I find a balance between my work and my belief in God?"
2085,"Looking for opinions and official teachings! 

Hebrews 10 makes it clear that Jesus’ sacrifice replaces sacrificial laws for us (like if you sin, you can no longer offer a lamb or something because Jesus gave the ultimate sacrifice for all). It seems like most Christians across denominations would say only the Ten Commandments and/or moral laws from the Old Testament need to be followed with a focus on the 2 Jesus says are most important (Matt. 22:36-40). This seems chaotic to me from a sola scriptura POV because who decides which laws are moral and which aren’t? For example, in the law the word abomination is used to describe eating unclean animals (Leviticus 11:10-11), crossdressing (Deut. 22:5-6), homosexual activity (Lev. 18:22), ripping people off (Deut. 25:13-16), worshipping other gods (Deut. 13:12-15), witchcraft (Deut. 18:10-12), prostitution male or female - (but this one is interesting because it’s about if a sacrifice is procured by those means so does it still stand alone?)(Deut.23:18)

Anyway the list on my Bible app goes on but I think I can make my point in asking with what we have here. How do we decide what God has commanded as moral? Some would say laws on uncleanliness are ritual and we don’t have to keep them, but how do we know God doesn’t categorize it as moral Himself? Why use the word abomination for pigs and also for a bunch of the other moral sins that are still upheld as sins in the NT? 

Mark 7:19 is often used to say all foods are clean but in the context of the whole chapter, Jesus is responding to those condemning them for eating with unwashed hands - which was not a law given by God, but a tradition that was treated as law by the Jews at that time. With that context I feel like it’s a stretch to say that verse 19 gives us permission to eat whatever we want, as opposed to it being a parable to explain that it’s your actions that defile you, or what happens as a result from what has entered you. The biggest stretch I can logically understand from this is it could be used to describe the grace we have under Christ that if you were to eat unclean, it’s not a huge deal but not an encouragement to eat what you want. I see it as similar to Matt. 12, Jesus isn’t saying “don’t keep the sabbath,” I’d say He’s saying either one or more of these points (I could be totally wrong though):
- If someone is following the example of a righteous man, they are guiltless ‭Matthew‬ ‭12‬:‭3 & 7 (the examples used were David and Himself)
- God wants a whole revamp on us thinking with mercy in mind instead of sacrifice, as in no need to starve on the sabbath if you have to work to get food, and to not condemn those who need to - I assume only the poor would have needed to as they wouldn’t have a home or a place to store food  and we know He came as an advocate of the poor
- Be reasonable, sometimes a person has to eat! 

So just to put both examples together, I think the point Jesus is making is that your actions and mercy shown to others are paramount to anything else and that the morality of the actions outside of love they neighbor and have no other Gods before me are up to Him (I am the Lord of the Sabbath - I take that to mean “it’s my day it’s my law, I’ll decide how this is to be judged”)

Now back to my original question of which laws are we meant to keep. I grew up in a cult that denied the deity of Christ but we did view him as Messiah and we didn’t keep the sacrificial laws but strived to keep all the rest. I now believe Jesus is and always was one with God. I’m researching different aspects of Christianity and watching many debates and I see many Christians justifying certain views using OT laws that seem like “moral laws” but I know they eat unclean animals, wear mixed fabrics etc. 

If it’s up to God himself, how do we decide which ones to follow and encourage others to follow? Basically, I want to come to an understanding on this so I can find a church that I feel aligns with the highest truth.

We can go by the rest of the NT like what Paul has to say on the law, but I’m not yet convinced on Paul’s authority- Peter said the OT law should be upheld by all (I feel comfortable with assuming he meant that with the caveats Jesus made regarding mercy of course) and he was made an authority by Jesus himself  Matt. 16:18. 

Anyway, I’m personally confused. I’m not sure if it’s ok to eat pork or not to keep the holy days (Passover, Yom Kippur etc) and I’d like to know what people think aside from what Paul has said. 

If you see any flaws in my points, understanding or arguments please bring them up! I already see some contradictions myself (I’ve said it’s your actions that defile you, not what enters you but Jesus said even a lustful thought is a sin and a lustful thought is something that could be argued as “entering you””) and I’m coming from a weird perspective so maybe I’m looking at this all wrong but it’s currently a huge stumbling block to me finding a community to worship and study with.

Note: Also I think it goes without saying that the parentheticals in Mark 7:19 (and thus all foods were declared clean) were added way after that book was written and who knows how it got there, I don’t see that as a proof in any sense."
2086,"I'm 27M and most certainly gay and closeted. My extremely conservative best and only friend and her husband have asked me to be god father to their baby boy.

I told them I think my Christian values are not good enough for them, but I didn't state the exact reason why. They said that I'm the most Christian person they know so they insisted and I accepted. But every time I'm in their company I'm not being honest.

2091,"Most Christian denominations say their form of practicing the religion is the only true, value one.

But has this claim ever been analyzed by objective non-biased parties?

Maybe most if not all of the forms that Christianity takes represent a large diversity of paths that all lead its followers to God in different ways. 

Can denominations see things in this way or must they always think they are the most right way to be a Christian and everyone else at best is less of a true Christian than they are?

Personally I do have a type of church that I prefer to go to over others, but I never think that this church is right for everyone else. On the contrary, I know that many Christians would not like this type of Church and it would be better for them to find one that works best for them.

But how common is this sentiment shared amongst the broader Christian world?"
2092,"*(from oca.org)*

For centuries the region of Tao-Klarjeti in southwestern Georgia was known for its holiness, unity and spiritual strength. The cultural life and faith of Kartli were nearly extinguished by the Arab-Muslim domination from the 8th to 10th centuries. Tao-Klarjeti, however, which had been emptied by a cholera epidemic and the aftermath of the Islamic invasions, filled with new churches and monasteries, becoming a destination for many Christian ascetics. Saint Ekvtime Taqaishvili wrote that “Every monastery included a school and a seminary where the Christian Faith, philosophy, Greek and other foreign languages, chant, calligraphy, fine arts, jewelry making, and other disciplines were taught. Countless priests, translators, miniaturists, and jewelry makers developed their craft in these schools.”

The prayers of [the Tao-Klarjeti monastics](https://images.oca.org/icons/lg/october/1005klarjeti.jpg) multiplied and were lifted up to the heavens like holy incense. Hagiographical works were written, original hymns composed, and theological texts translated.

The literature of this period was thoroughly infused with the spirit of the Georgian people. Tao-Klarjeti reinvigorated the soul of the Georgian people and redirected the lost back to the true path.

**Saint Gregory of Khandzta**, a priest of great virtue and wisdom, spearheaded this spiritual revival. He was a good shepherd to his flock and the builder of many churches. The Lives of Saint Gregory of Khandzta and the other holy fathers and mothers of Tao-Klarjeti are recounted in **Saint George Merchule**'s work *The Life of Saint Gregory of Khandzta*. George Merchule labored in the Khandzta wilderness in the 10th century. His epithet, “Merchule,” means “the theologian” or literally “the knower of the law.”

George Merchule also provided the Church with the Life of **Holy Catholicos Nerse III**, an Armenian by descent. Nerse confessed the Orthodox Faith and labored in Tao-Klarjeti with the Georgian fathers. (At that time many Orthodox Armenians fled to Tao-Klarjeti after being exiled from their homeland.) In the first half of the 7th century Saint Nerse laid the foundations of Ishkhani Church and labored there in holiness.

**Holy Catholicos Hilarion** was the founder and abbot of Tsqarostavi Church and a disciple of Gregory of Khandzta. He arrived at Khandzta Monastery with his spiritual father, Saint David, Abbot of Midznadzori Monastery, and Saint Zachariah, the builder of Beretelta Church. Those who witnessed the fathers’ unity and piety abandoned the world to join them in offering their lives to God. In the middle of the 9th century Saint Hilarion was enthroned as Catholicos of Kartli in recognition of his wisdom and holiness. He followed Gabriel II (ca. 830-850) and was succeeded by Arsenius I “the Great” (ca. 860-887) in this most honorable role.

**Saint Stephen of Tbeti** was the first bishop of Tbeti. He was a major writer and hagiographer in the Church of his time and a brilliant figure of the Tao-Klarjeti literary school. Saint Stephen is credited with authoring the narrative *The Martyrdom of Saint Gobron*.

From his childhood **Saint Zachariah of Anchi** was filled with love and fear of God. Strict in his discipline but free from every constraint of this world, he led the life of a shepherd like St. David the Psalmist. As a child, Saint Zachariah would gather his friends and relate with precision the words and scenes he had witnessed in churches and monasteries. Once the bishop of Anchi observed this unusual pastime and reported seeing a pillar of light descend fromthe heavens and alight atop St. Zachariah’s head.

When he reached a mature age, Saint Zachariah became the spiritual leader of his brothers. Through his prayers many miracles were performed: he stopped the stone wall of a collapsing building from crashing to the ground, eliminated the troublesome birds and grasshoppers from the monastery’s vineyard, and killed two venomous snakes that were keeping his frightened brothers from the vineyard. Filled with good faith and virtue, Saint Zachariah was later consecrated bishop of Anchi.

**Saint Macarius of Anchi** served as bishop of Anchi following the repose of Saint Gregory of Khandzta in 861.

**Saint Ezra of Anchi**, of the noble Dapanchuli family, labored in holiness during the 10th century.

**Saint Savva of Ishkhani** was a cousin and one of the closest companions of St. Gregory of Khandzta. Along with two other friends, Christopher and Theodore, the young Savva accompanied Gregory of Khandzta to Klarjeti on a quest for the ascetic life. At first the young monks settled at Opiza Monastery and labored there with great zeal, and afterwards they moved to Khandzta.

Once Saint Savva made a pilgrimage with Saint Gregory to Byzantium, and there he learned the typica of the local monasteries. On the way back to Tao-Klarjeti, God revealed to them His will for Savva to restore Ishkhani Church, which had been destroyed by Arab-Muslim invaders. Saint Savva desired to begin this holy task at once, but he continued on the way with Saint Gregory at the latter’s insistence.

Later, Gregory assigned two monks to help Savva restore the church and sent the three of them to Ishkhani. By God’s grace, the brothers restored the church and monastery and the number of monks who labored there multiplied. Before long their abbot, Saint Savva, was consecrated bishop of Ishkhani.

**Saint John the New Martyr for Christ** labored at Khandzta Monastery. While he was journeying to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, the Saracens captured him in Baghdad and attempted to torture him into a denial of the Christian Faith. But by shedding his blood Saint John demonstrated his immutable fidelity to the Faith of our Savior.

**Saint Theodore, Founder of Nedzvi Monastery**, and **Saint Christopher, Founder of the Dviri Monastery of Saint Cyricus**, were spiritual sons of Saint Gregory of Khandzta and the first men to join him in his holy labors.

With Saint Gregory they labored first at Opiza and later at Khandzta Monastery. These holy fathers journeyed to Abkhazeti to increase the fullness of the Faith in that region, and on their way, in Samtskhe, an aristocrat named Mirian entrusted them with the care and upbringing of his son, the six-year-old Arsenius (later Holy Catholicos Arsenius the Great).

Eventually Saint Gregory of Khandzta desired the return of Theodore and Christopher, and he traveled to Abkhazeti to find them. Saint Gregory took with him his young disciple Ephraim (later the bishop and wonderworker of Atsquri). When he met the brothers in Abkhazeti, Saint Gregory entrusted them with Ephraim’s upbringing and made them vow not to leave Khandzta Monastery until Ephraim and Arsenius had reached maturity.

When Ephraim and Arsenius reached manhood they were “perfected in wisdom,” and Theodore and Christopher left Khandzta to establish the Nedzvi and Dviri Monasteries. There each father labored until the day of his repose.

**Holy Fathers George, Amona, Peter, and Macarius** labored in the wilderness of Opiza. Abba George was abbot of Opiza’s Saint John the Baptist Monastery during the two years Saint Gregory of Khandzta and his companions labored there. Fr. George was the third abbot of the monastery (he was succeeded by **Saint Andria and Saint Samuel**).

Through God’s grace Abba George recognized the pilgrims’ faith and received them, not as pupils, but as honorable and wise elders. Witnessing the ascetic feats of the venerable fathers of Opiza, Saint Gregory increased in virtue and humility, and acquired inner peace. (History has preserved a Holy Gospel from the Opiza Wilderness that has been dated to the year 913, around the time that Abba George was laboring there.)

In the second part of the 9th century **Saint Serapion of Zarzma** founded Zarzma Monastery in Samtskhe. Saint Serapion’s nephew, **Saint Basil**, later performed great ascetic feats and worked miracles at that monastery. Saint Basil authored *The Life of Serapion of Zarzma* and recounted the lives of the other venerable fathers of Zarzma as well.

**Saint George**, “a brilliant and kindhearted man of great virtue,” succeeded Saint Serapion as abbot of Zarzma Monastery. After Saint George, the **Venerable Abbot Michael** began building a second church in Zarzma, in fulfillment of Saint Serapion’s prophecy. **Saint Paul**, who followed Michael as abbot of the monastery, completed construction of this second church.

The holy and righteous **Saint Khvedios** labored as a hermit in the caves of the Khandzta Wilderness. God revealed to him the news of Saint Gregory’s arrival, and he received Gregory and his brothers with great joy.

He blessed them, while receiving a blessing himself from Saint Gregory of Khandzta. Then, rather than journeying on with Saint Gregory and the other brothers, Saint Khvedios retired to his secluded cave, since he had taken a vow before God to live his whole life in solitude. After the holy father reposed, his dwelling place filled with a sweet fragrance.

**Saint Epiphanius** was a wonderworker and a spiritual son of Saint Gregory of Khandzta. This venerable father was truly clad in the armor of righteousness, and he was an inspiration to many. According to Saint Gregory’s instructions, he became an example of obedience for the other brothers of the monastery. Saint Epiphanius’s prayers healed many who were afflicted by terminal illnesses.

**Saint Matthew** labored in the Khandzta Wilderness. After the abbess of Mere Monastery reposed, he took upon himself leadership of the women’s monastery and for forty years set an example of life lived in the fullness of the Faith. He was so strict in his asceticism that, for those forty years, he never once shared a meal with the mothers, nor did he receive a single object from any of their hands. When Saint Matthew reached an advanced age, he became diseased in the flesh, but he declined the nuns’ offers to care for him. Instead he asked his relative, also a monk, to attend to him in his time of need.

**Saint Zenon** was born in Samtskhe to a family of aristocrats. He was raised in the fear of God, and he desired from his youth to enter the monastic life. Before this desire was fulfilled, however, his sister was kidnapped by a certain godless man. Zenon set off to pursue the abductor on horseback, but while he was riding the devil began to assault him with anxieties. “I am a respectable man,” he thought, “but the one whom I am following is dishonorable. If I catch and kill him, I will destroy my soul, but if I turn back, shame will come upon me.”

And so, at that very moment, Saint Zenon turned back to fulfill his lifelong desire. He was tonsured a monk and later became a disciple of Saint Gregory of Khandzta.

Saint Zenon, the “Treasure of Virtue, Holy Model of Asceticism and Gate of the Klarjeti Wilderness,” reposed at an advanced age.

**Saint John, Abbot of Khandzta**, is celebrated for having completed construction of the new church at Khandzta that was begun by his predecessor, **Saint Arsenius**. Both holy fathers reposed in the Khandzta Wilderness.

**Saint Theodore the Abbot** and his brother **Saint John** both labored at Khandzta Monastery. Saint George Merchule recognizes the brothers as co-authors, with him, of the work *The Life of Saint Gregory of Khandzta*; historians, however, believe that they were contributors, rather than coauthors, of this work.

The monk **Saint Gabriel** ministered to the infirm and elderly monks of Khandzta Monastery. Saint Gabriel verbally recounted the Lives of the great Church Fathers and admonished his brothers to follow the same strict disciplines as the fathers who had gone before them.

**Saint Demetrius** was raised by the blessed Saint Febronia and later became one of Saint Gregory of Khandzta’s first disciples. He is commemorated among the holy fathers for having attaining the heights of the monastic struggle and for working wonders, both in this life and after he had been received into the bosom of Abraham.

**SS. Arsenius and Macarius**, “good monks full of wisdom and the gift of wonderworking,” were relatives of Saint Ephraim of Atsquri. They labored together at Saint Savva Monastery in Jerusalem and corresponded regularly with the monks of Khandzta. Saints Arsenius and Macarius possessed a profound love for Christ and a longing to serve their motherland and mother Church.

**Saint Shio the Wonderworker** “shone upon the land of Kartli like the North Star in the morning sky.” According to Basil of Zarzma, Saint Shio was the spiritual father of Saint Michael of Parekhi.

**SS. Basil and Markelus**, “abounding and brilliant in virtue,” were disciples of Saint Michael of Parekhi. Saint Basil was buried in Parekhi next to his spiritual father. Both fathers worked miracles from their graves and healed the infirmities of the faithful who came to seek their blessings.

**Venerable Father David**, “an image of the angels” and builder of many monasteries, labored as abbot of Midznadzori Monastery. He was the spiritual father of the holy catholicos Hilarion.

Endowed with many gifts of grace, **Saint Jacob** was a prominent figure in the tenth-century Georgian Church. He labored first in Shatberdi, and later near Midznadzori Gorge, where he shone forth as the brightest of stars.

**Venerable Sophronius the Great** was the restorer of the Shatberdi Church and a famous writer, but his literary works have not been preserved.

Saint George Merchule numbers him among the wise and holy fathers whose stories are worthy to be told. **Saint Gregory of Shatberdi** labored at the same monastery. Several of the tenth-century manuscripts copied by him at Shatberdi Monastery have been preserved, including the *Notebooks of the Shatberdi Wilderness* and the Gospels of Hadishi, Jruchi, and Parekhi.

**Saint Zachariah** built the famous Beretelta Monastery and set an example of wisdom and holiness for the fathers who labored there after him.

Saint George Merchule honors the venerable and God-fearing **Saint Hilarion of Parekhi** as one of the greatest writers and figures in the Church of his time.

**Saint Hilarion, Abbot of Ubisi**, labored for many years at the Lavra of Saint Savva in Jerusalem, where the Georgians had their own chapel for many centuries (See Archimandrite Gregory Peradze, “An Account of the Georgian Monks and Monasteries in Palestine,” *Georgica*, Autumn 1937, nos. 4-5, pp. 181-246.). After he had reached an advanced age, the venerable father moved to Georgia and settled at Khandzta Monastery. Later this clever and learned father began construction of Ubisi Church in Imereti, where he labored until his death.

**Saint Febronia** labored at Mere Monastery in Samtskhe. She was a close friend of Saint Gregory of Khandzta. He sent to her a certain woman whom King Ashot Kuropalates (later the holy martyr) had taken as his mistress, to instruct her in the Christian Faith. Saint Febronia denied the king’s pleas to return the woman to the royal palace.

Angels often visited Saint Febronia to inform her of God’s holy will. **Saint Temestia** labored with Saint Febronia at Mere Monastery. For forty years she ministered to Saint Matthew, the spiritual father of the monastery. Saint Temestia herself remarked that her relationship with Father Matthew was so chaste and innocent that the holy father would not even permit himself to receive the holy incense directly from her hands.

**Saint Anatole** (also called Antonios) labored in seclusion at Mere Monastery. Angels often appeared to the holy mother, who herself led a life equal to that of the bodiless powers. Both venerable Temestia and Anatole were informed by angels of the repose of their abbot, St. Matthew.

**Saint Anastasia** labored among the holy mothers in remarkable sanctity and humility. She descended from an Abkhaz family and was known as Bevreli in the world. As queen (the wife of King Adarnerse) she was often called upon to protect the interests of Mere Monastery.

King Adarnerse later grew cold towards Bevreli, so she left the world and was tonsured a nun with the name Anastasia. Saint Anastasia bore the most difficult labor at the monastery: she gathered the firewood and carried it from the forest. She wore only rags and prayed constantly.

Once King Adarnerse suddenly fell ill, and he sent messengers to Persati Monastery, where Anastasia was laboring, asking forgiveness on his behalf. Saint Anastasia prayed for the sick king: “May Christ forgive all his sins and heal him in soul and body.” King Adarnerse was soon healed of his infirmity.

Abounding in holiness and humility, Saint Anastasia labored at Persati Monastery to the end of her days on earth. God granted her the gift of wonderworking both during her life on earth and after her repose.

Saint Anastasia’s own sons, Gurgen and Sumbat, were cured of their diseases at her grave, and afterwards many more who came with faith received healing from the holy mother.

The historical region of Tao-Klarjeti has throughout history, and even up to the present day, been inhabited by ethnic Georgians. However, since 1921, when the Communists annulled the independence of the Georgian Republic, Tao-Klarjeti has been a Turkish possession.

God endowed this region with abundant sunshine and clear air, free from cruel heat and bitter frost. The local climate heightens the beauty of this wondrous region.

But Tao-Klarjeti has been transformed into a battlefield countless times throughout history: it has witnessed victory and defeat, destruction and restoration, treason and selfless loyalty. Through all these trials it has remained an inseparable part of the unified Georgian nation. In spite of the fact that, today, Tao-Klarjeti is located within the borders of a foreign government and its Georgian dioceses are often referred to as belonging to the Armenian Church, the historical truth must be upheld.

On October 17, 2002, the Georgian Apostolic Church nominally restored the dioceses of Klarjeti and Lazeti to its own jurisdiction and declared the incumbent bishop of Akhaltsikhe to be their spiritual leader. On the same day, the Georgian Church canonized the holy and venerable fathers and mothers who labored in those regions under the leadership of Saint Gregory of Khandzta. Only a few of the God-fearing laborers, among them Holy Catholicos Nerse II, were Armenian by descent, but they had converted to Orthodoxy and preached the true Faith in the wilderness with the Georgian fathers."
2093,"A friend of mine just texted me earlier this week and wrote something simple, 'continue to walk in obedience with God'. It made me ask what exactly is walking in obedience, so I developed an 11 part devotional series on what that looks like. Below you'll find a monologue of the 2nd part of it regarding repentance. If you read it, I think you'll agree all of us need a friend like Ella.

  

Ella sat across from me, her hazel eyes locked onto mine, absorbing every word, every emotion. The dim lighting in the small coffee shop painted a soft glow on her face, highlighting the concern etched into her delicate features. 

I took a deep breath, my voice quivering as I began. ""It was a brisk autumn evening when it happened, Ella."" The memory of the sky's colors blended into a mix of soft orange and deep purple surfaced, and I found myself momentarily lost in the vastness of that moment. I could see her leaning in, her eyebrows knitted in a mix of concern and curiosity. 

""The world... it felt so vast, so immense. And I felt like a speck, lost, and swallowed by its enormity."" My hands trembled slightly as I clutched my mug for warmth. ""I had made a choice, Ella. A choice I deeply regretted.""

Her gaze intensified, her lips parting slightly as if to say something but then she hesitated, waiting for me to continue.

""The weight of what I'd done... it felt like a hundred-pound anchor."" I placed a hand over my chest, emphasizing the gravity that tugged at my very soul. ""It wasn't just about the act, you know? It was the realization that I had deliberately strayed from the path I knew was meant for me.""

Ella's eyes shimmered with the beginning of tears. She placed a gentle hand on mine, her touch filled with understanding. I swallowed hard, memories of the prodigal son echoing my own follies. ""I squandered the blessings I'd been given, chasing fleeting pleasures and empty promises.""

The rawness of my confession left a thick tension in the air. I blinked rapidly, fighting back the tears. ""That night was... it was one of the hardest. It felt like I was drowning in sorrow."" I could hear my voice breaking, the pain resurfacing with each word.

Her grip on my hand tightened, a silent promise that she was there, listening, and understanding.

""As dawn broke, there was this... whisper,"" I said, pausing to find the right words. ""A gentle reminder that despite everything, God's love was unchanging. Every new morning brought with it His mercy.""

Ella's eyes closed briefly, taking a moment to process my words. She opened them again, filled with warmth and empathy. ""What did you do?""

""I fell to my knees, Ella."" My voice was barely above a whisper, choked with emotion. ""Everything within me was raw and exposed. But in that vulnerability, I found the strength to turn back, to seek forgiveness.""

Her face softened with a gentle smile. ""And you found your way back?""

I nodded slowly. ""The journey wasn't easy. Facing the consequences, making amends... accepting God's grace."" I took a deep breath. ""But every tear, every prayer, it brought me closer to a love that's truly relentless.""

Ella's voice was gentle but filled with conviction. ""Your story, it's a testament, you know? A testament to infinite grace. In a world that constantly tells us to keep going, there's such power in pausing, reflecting, and when needed, turning back.""

I leaned in, locking eyes with her once again. ""Always remember this, Ella. Amidst the noise and pressures of this world, there's a voice, whispering the sweetest truth: 'Come back, beloved. My arms are open wide.'""

She nodded, tears streaming down her face. We sat there for a moment, two souls connected by the rawness of life's journey and the boundless grace that guides us through.

2094,"My dad was incredibly abusive to us kids growing up. He would strip us naked and hold us between his legs and break wooden spoons on our back, lower legs, bottom. He would do other things but that was his “main” spanking ritual. Worse happened to me. I’m the only daughter. 

He’s calmed down over the years but I’ve been watching videos on toxic families and I fit the mold to to tee where it says you are in your mid 30’s when you confront the abuse in the family and want to talk about it. You are labeled all kinds names and called all kinds of things. “You have issues, you are dramatic etc.” This is what the videos say and it’s true. 

My mom just told me I’m not allowed to talk to her if I say anything negative against my (abusive) dad. 

How insane is that? I’m trying to decide whether the whole damn family is toxic?! There is much more context I can give but wanted to keep it brief. 

I have my own kids and family and feel guilty about walking away. But I would love advice from those that have dealt with the same. I’m fine walking away (except, I own majority % in a business with my dad)"
2095,What is the most thing affecting you in Christianity
2096,"Why is it stressful to live in this world? Why is it stressful to live in a world of evil living with sinners. Now I’m not trying to judge, but when people sin, they don’t know what they’re doing and it stresses me out a ton."
2097,"Talking casually to God just makes me more like my true self and I’ll be able to share more things with him. But I heard someone said we should not do it, because when we talk casually it makes us forget his holiness. I just want to feel closer to him tho, what do you think?"
2098,Hi guys. I am really struggling with having no friends at the moment. It is really eating me up to the point where the depression is almost a daily constant. I am yearning for a life that is full of fun and connection and things to look forward to. I don’t have that at the moment and haven’t for a long while now. Please pray for me…
2099,"Ive been becoming more and more skeptical with my faith, Christianity, and I’m starting to lose my faith. This ain’t a question of which religion is correct, what I’m about to say is applicable to any monotheistic religion. Im brought into existence by God, I never asked to he brought into existence and I never would’ve known if I wasn’t. Im put onto the earth with desires and natural wants and needs, all while he  specifically creates a definition of perfection that requires me to fight off those wants and needs he created. Not one soul in all of human existence has ever been able to follow his rules to a T, besides “himself”. Is it not safe to say say we’re destined to fail? But at the same time he gets mad and threatens us with eternity of damnation and suffering if I, inevitably, do fail. And the only way out is to beg for forgiveness for such failures. The creator designed a product, and when that product does what it’s designed to do, he gets mad and threatens to destroy that  product. The only way for that product to be saved is to apologize for its own flawed design. How does that make sense? I’m created with free will and I can’t do what I want with my own existence because if I don’t do what he wants, then he’ll make the rest of my existence full of suffering and pain for all eternity. And If I’m destined to go to hell and endure suffering for all of eternity and he knows this before I’m even created, then why create me into damnation? Why create a life form whose destiny in the end is to suffer for eternity? I mean this is existence in a nutshell. I’d like it if someone can answer some of these questions for me or at least speak on this. Thanks."

2101,"I like to play videogames but when I hear God's word or remember it, suddenly I panic and become so anxious because I fear that I might go to hell or lose my salvation because of gaming. My mother says it is ok to play, I already talked to my pastor and he said it's ok to have fun (I didn't say what games do I play, I am thinking if I will talk to him soon).
The games I play are most shooting and horror games like resident evil for example.
Now I'm playing lies of p and starfield.

My conscious says it's fine, that I am not commiting a sin because it's just a game and I will never do the things that happens in the game. It's just a hobby. And I don't see anything in the bible that condemning gaming.

The problem is that I might have OCD ( Obssessive compulsive disorder) and this give me a lot of suffering. 
The formula of my problem is this:

Whenever I hear or remember God's eord, my brain start to analyze everything in my life like if I did or do something wrong or a sin. Then comes the terrible anxiety and until I solve it I am tormented by it. Then repeat. 

Now i would stop playing videogame or some genre if God wanted. But the problem is that I don't want to give in to this condition because, today is videogame, later it will be walking in street or worse, like it has happened to me that my nail touched my church seat and I started panicking that I had to buy another one for my church because I ""scratched"" and ruined it.

I know it doesn't make sense. that playing is not a sin, my conscious says it too..
But i can't let go of this fear of going to hell. It's too strong. 

Thanks for reading it and for your patience.

2103,"Hi all,

I’m wondering about how Christian doctrine treats miracles, both historic (like Jesus turning water into wine) and modern (like those medical miracles confirmed by the Catholic Church). Does Christian tradition discourage attempts to explain these miracles in scientific terms?

Say that a chemist managed to show that there exists some substance that’s perceptually indistinguishable from water but can be rapidly transformed under some circumstances into an alcoholic substance that’s similar to wine. Would it be heretical to claim that this is a good partial explanation for how Jesus performed his miracle? Must miracles be purely mysterious?"

2105,"I meant to post this earlier this week, as it is a reflection on the Scripture readings for this past Sunday.  But either way, God's fairness comes up a lot.  

 [**Ez 18:25-28**](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/ezekiel/18?25) 

""Thus says the LORD:  
You say, ""The LORD's way is not fair!""  
Hear now, house of Israel:  
Is it my way that is unfair, or rather, are not your ways unfair?  
When someone virtuous turns away from virtue to commit iniquity, and dies,  
it is because of the iniquity he committed that he must die.  
But if he turns from the wickedness he has committed,  
and does what is right and just,  
he shall preserve his life;  
since he has turned away from all the sins that he has committed,  
he shall surely live, he shall not die.""

 [**Mt 21:28-32**](https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/21?28) 

 ""Jesus said to the chief priests and elders of the people:  
'What is your opinion?  
A man had two sons.  
He came to the first and said,  
'Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.'  
He said in reply, 'I will not,'  
but afterwards changed his mind and went.  
The man came to the other son and gave the same order.  
He said in reply, 'Yes, sir, 'but did not go.  
Which of the two did his father's will?'  
They answered, 'The first.'  
Jesus said to them, 'Amen, I say to you,  
tax collectors and prostitutes  
are entering the kingdom of God before you.  
When John came to you in the way of righteousness,  
you did not believe him;  
but tax collectors and prostitutes did.  
Yet even when you saw that,  
you did not later change your minds and believe him.'"" 

The concept of Hell is not a pleasant one. It would be nice if Hell did not exist. God is perfectly good, not nice. We understand that it is good for a parent to discipline their child, though particular methods might not be good. When we sin, we say ""Forgive me Lord, for I have sinned against God and against Man."" We sin against man, who is temporal, and so we incur temporal punishment. But we also sin against God, who is eternal, so we must also incur eternal punishment.

But we know that as Christians that is not the end of the story. In fact our sin is not even the start of the story. We were created to be perfect, but we screwed it up. ""But if he turns from the wickedness he has committed, and does what is right and just, he shall preserve his life;..."" Crist died on the Cross, so that we might be forgiven. ""...Take and drink. This is my blood. The blood of the New and Everlasting Covenant that is poured out for you and for many, for the forgiveness of sin."" Our God is also a merciful God. Note that we do not preserve our life automatically, we must turn from the wickedness that we commit, to preserve our life. We obtain our life by believing in Christ, we maintain and preserve our life, by repenting from and avoiding evil. As such, those that say that we are not saved by works are right, but it IS through works that we CONTINUE to be saved and merit (not earn) a *greater* participation in the life of Jesus. It is through Baptism that we are initially brought to justification and joined to Christ's body. We have the Sacrament of Reconciliation to be able to access God's forgiveness in a physical way. Baptism wipes clean any and every sin we have committed up to that point. Reconciliation does the same for any sin that we confess (and repent from).

At the end of our life, if we still have eternal consequences that have not been accounted for through Confession, we will go to Hell. If we still have temporal punishment, not yet accounted for through Confession, we go to Purgatory. Every single soul in Purgatory WILL go to Heaven. It is preparing those souls to fully be able to enter into the beatific vision of Heaven. 

There are many who say ""But an eternal Hell is not fair!"" But the first passage from Ezekiel disproves that right off the back. Our God is good, just, and merciful. He is infinitely perfect and blessed in Himself!"

My atheist friend dreamt of Archangel Michael yesterday, Saturday September 30th. A day before that he (an atheist) and i (an orthodox) talked about the psychology of Christianity and other atheist philosophers (camus etc).

He described the dream

""At first just epileptic seizures of holy icons and orthodox crosses and icons of holy Mary and other holy women (specifically Mary) just flashing at me at first. Then i saw someone who had dark wings but blurred dark face with longer hair and a sword in LEFT hand, his right hand was deformed. He put his sword directly at me and said ""Take matters into your own hands or else bad things will happen"" and the dream ends there. After he woke up with just some image in his head of those epileptic images of crosses and icons and later on remembered the whole dream after seeing an Instagram reel of the 7 Wonders (or sleepers) of Ephesus, not that it matters it's just that he remembered the dream from there.

Then when he went to village cemetary with hus family an old lady friend of his family was there but she wasn't feeling good and almost passed out, her daughter was screaming and crying while she almost collapsed, but it was all good because my friend called an ambulance and helped the old lady (gave her water and all and told the girl to stop crying) calming the situation and helping the lady that almost died there.

He is basically very confused now and can't comprehend it all but said he will go back to God after basically whole life rejecting him (he was born Christian orthodox).

COINCIDENCE, I THINK NOT. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?? WHAT DOES THIS DREAM OF ARCHANGEL MICHAEL SHOWING UP TO MY ATHEIST FRIEND MEAN??? 

&#x200B;

Btw he told me 2 weeks before that he said he stopped finding a reason to search for the truth in christianity because he no longer wanted to research it, he was happy as an atheist. Hes now going to lithurgy in sunday and fasting whole week. What the fuck was this."

2111,"I am not sure if I am athiest or agnostic or what. I can probably quote the bible better than most Christians. I was visiting the Athiesm reddit as I usually do to read the posts. Then I saw a post about someone saying their father died when they were 10 years old. Turns out most prominent atheists had a common theme. That theme is abandonment, or the death of a father or emotionally distant fathers. 

I’m 34 years old. Yet I just learned of the term father wound. The problem is my father left before I was born and was raised by my mother and grandmother. My mother had me out of wedlock, she dated a couple other guys who were abusive or didnt care for the kids. I was raised in the LDS church, went to a jehovahs witness church, when I was 10 I went to foster care. Even then though i had foster dads…I never allowed myself to get close to them. When I was adopted at 16. Even then my adopted father felt absent. Even went to every church denomination. 

Still today I have a hard time believing in God or Jesus or the Bible stuff. Could be because of the father wound. But essentially If God is real. Then basically im royally fucked and going to hell. Cuz I cant just say oh I believe Jesus is real, especially if I dont whole heartedly believe. So I guess do you think some people are pre-destined to hell? Like God knows you’re not going to believe so why bother?"
2112,"Is it bad that I am wanting to start taking my walk with more independently? I really enjoy listening t worship music alone, praying alone, watching sermons on YouTube alone, and especially enjoy reading my bible alone because how I interpret the word can be based on the specific season I am in my life, and how I believe God wants me to apply the word to my daily life, which may be different for everyone depending on what they're currently going through. Overall, I do have a good amount of Christian friends that I do go to when I have questions, need urgent prayers, I pray for them as well. I am in college right now, and part of a campus ministry group that has events and meetup often, but I much more enjoy growing with God mainly on my own. Is it bad to think this way?"
2113,"The Guardian does a weekly article series called ""Dining across the divide"". They get two volunteers with opposing worldviews (usually political differences), give them a paid for meal at some restaurents and in return the two give their views on their discussions.

I would have liked it to be more in depth, but they do mention discussions on euthanasia and abortion  as you'd expect. From my reading of it the atheist guy is more willing to bend or even change his views, but the Catholic guy's views are set, he's never going to change his mind on any of these hot button topics. At one point the Catholic guy says that he would probably have agreed with the atheist before he became Catholic.

I just don't get it, why would you want to hamper your ability to seek truth by wrapping yourself in chains of dogma? To people that have taken that step into religion what's the attraction? I'm genuinely confused."
2114,"I apologize in advance for such a long post haha. 

I’m a 23 year old male (24 soon) who has been going through quite the existential crisis over the past month over who I am and my destiny in life and after it. I’m newly married, have a good corporate job which I know are huge blessings in my life and I have no regrets attached to either of them, but I have been obsessed over intrusive thoughts lately, specifically over the realization over details of own existence and my future death. These thoughts have absolutely terrified me. 

My parents are some of the strongest Christians I have ever met, and they have always taught me the power of Christ and have devoted their lives to him (like seriously my mom’s main hobby is reading the Bible and my dad is an elder; they are extremely devout). Here’s the problem I am coming to realize: I am not even sure I believe in God. I’m a very literal person and have always read a lot about science and just the world in general, and I’m not sure I believe in the scientific view of the world either (that we evolved from single celled organisms out of the cosmos all by chance). I guess I’m just skeptical of everything existential at the moment.

Through all of this I have come to a realization: I greatly desire the religion I have been taught by my family to be true, and if Jesus makes himself visible to me I have no hesitation to serve him with all my being. This world is a messed up place and I already know chasing  physical pleasures does not lead to happiness. 

So I guess what I’m asking (in probably the longest way possible I do apologize) is for anyone who is willing to share their conversion stories. Anyone who did not believe that the story of God and Jesus was anything more than something made up by scared mortal humans and then had everything change, I would love to hear your story. Thanks!"

Just 2 months ago, I re-dedicated my life to Jesus and I have yet to schedule a water baptism. Finished reading John's Gospel.

For the past 6 months, I keep looking at the time when it reads ""3:16"". Obviously, this alludes to John 3:16. I've heard plenty of spiritual phenomena regarding repetitive numbers, like 111, 222, 333, etc. Is God really trying to tell me something by showing me the numbers 316 over and over?"

*Trust in YHWH with all your heart; and lean not on your own understanding.*

*In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your paths.*

*Be not wise in your own eyes: fear YHWH and depart from evil.*

*It will be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones. (Prov 3:5-8)*

It is extremely important for us to not lean on our own understandings, and instead seek God for wisdom in every situation. 

This world is decepetive and subject to change. Therefore we need to rely on our almighty Creator for direction in every situation. We need to seek a renewed understanding, a deeper understanding. This can only come from humbling ourselves and continually asking God for counsel.

We all have some level of understanding of whatever is unfolding in our lives. We need this understanding to move foward. The key is to not view our understanding as infallible. Because this world is deceptive and subject to change, leaning on our own understandings can lead us astray. We need to be open to the fact that there is much we do not know, and only by continually seeking the Most High God YHWH for counsel can we stay on the right path. 

We need to move forward with confidence. Our confidence must be rooted in our relationship with God, the fact that we seek God for wisdom and a renewed understanding in every situation, the fact that we desire to be obedient to God."

\[1\] God presides in the great assembly. He judges among the gods. \[2\] “How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality to the wicked?” Selah. \[3\] “Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless. Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed. \[4\] Rescue the weak and needy. Deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.” \[5\] They don’t know, neither do they understand. They walk back and forth in darkness. All the foundations of the earth are shaken. \[6\] I said, “You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High. \[7\] Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one of the rulers.” \[8\] Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.

‭‭John‬ ‭10:29‭-‬38‬ ‭WEBUS‬‬

\[29\] My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand. \[30\] I and the Father are one.” \[31\] Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone him. \[32\] Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?” \[33\] The Jews answered him, “We don’t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God.” \[34\] Jesus answered them, “Isn’t it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? \[35\] If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can’t be broken), \[36\] do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You blaspheme,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’? \[37\] If I don’t do the works of my Father, don’t believe me. \[38\] But if I do them, though you don’t believe me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”

‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭28:9‭-‬19‬ ‭WEBUS‬‬

\[9\] Whom will he teach knowledge? To whom will he explain the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts? \[10\] For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little. \[11\] But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language, \[12\] to whom he said, “This is the resting place. Give rest to the weary,” and “This is the refreshing;” yet they would not hear. \[13\] Therefore Yahweh’s word will be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, fall backward, be broken, be snared, and be taken. \[14\] Therefore hear Yahweh’s word, you scoffers, that rule this people in Jerusalem: \[15\] “Because you have said, ‘We have made a covenant with death, and we are in agreement with Sheol. When the overflowing scourge passes through, it won’t come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.’” \[16\] Therefore the Lord Yahweh says, “Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation. He who believes shall not act hastily. \[17\] I will make justice the measuring line, and righteousness the plumb line. The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding place. \[18\] Your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand. When the overflowing scourge passes through, then you will be trampled down by it. \[19\] As often as it passes through, it will seize you; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night; and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.”

‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭3:1‭-‬3‬ ‭WEBUS‬‬

\[1\] Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ. \[2\] I fed you with milk, not with solid food, for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, you aren’t ready even now, \[3\] for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?

I was born in the factory far away from the milky teat what's the use? Oh, what's the use?

You cheered as I was split in half!

A Mechanical sacrificial calf for you, Oh all for you

Steam Engenius you see,

Steam Engenius enough to answer anything you need,

But what's the use?

Human nature was installed in me

I did what's right but naturally it wasn't natural.

Still not my fault, no

I held in my hands the beating heart of a robot, he'd lost his car

It was sitting there waiting in a parking lot crying out just for you.

Woohoo, Woohoo, Woohoo, Woohoo

What a waste of time what a waste of words what a waste of strength

Well I spoke in binary and you for volume and dizzying length"
2119,Seems like God would only do something like that if he knew humans would be terrified otherwise.
2120,"I was born again, I feel and see Jesus all the time now. I will write books about what happened to me. There is nothing like the truth of the Bible and the life it breathes into your dead heart. Selfish behavior is the root of all evil.

2121,"I sure hope so.  
One person who was with me in middle school raped another classmate with a needle. This story haunts me and i'm in my twenties.

I let divine justice do its will."
2122,"I've been a Christian my whole life and attend church every Sunday. I love God. I genuinely do. I love worship, and I love going to youth groups for fellowship. However, I can never bring myself to enjoy sermons. It's most likely due to my ADHD, but my mind either zones out or I get sleepy within 5-10 minutes of the sermon. I simply can't stand sitting down and listening to someone talk for 40+ minutes. This doesn't just go for sermons either; I feel the same way in my classes at college. Professors who just talk for the entire class bore me to death too. I leave church every Sunday feeling bad that I didn't get much out of it, especially when the main part of a service is the sermon. Does anyone else have this problem?"
2123,"She is the world's best peacemaker. She is faithful, kind, and gentle. She cares about the needy and goes the second mile to help when there is a need. A mother is Christ-like and a mother would lay down her life for her children."
2124,"So lately, I've been rereading the Left Behind books. I've just finished the third book, which is Nicolae: The Rise of Antichrist. The book ended with the Seal #6 occurring, otherwise known as the Wrath of the Lamb.

This is what the book of Revelation says about the 6th seal. I'm going to quote from my NJV (New Jerusalem Version) bible. The sixth seal is opened in **Revelation 6:12-17**. This is what it says:

>**12.** And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and whole moon became as blood. **13.** And the stars of heaven fell to earth, like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind. **14.** Then the sky was removed like a scroll when it rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out their places. **15.** And the kinds of the earth, the princes, the commanders, the rick, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves in the rooks of the mountains. **16.** And the told the mountains and the rocks, ""Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and save from the wrath of the Lamb, **17.** for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?""

How do y'all interpret this verse? What do you take as being literal and what is figurative? Do you think that this is something that has already happened, or do you feel like this is something that is yet to come?

I know that the Book of Revelation is one of the most confusing books to some, and that to others, it is easy to understand. But what are y'all's thoughts?"
2125,"God is present in all places and at all moments, regardless of physical or temporal boundaries. This makes the Trinity possible.

Psalm 139:7-10 ""Where can I go from your Spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I go up to the heavens, you are there; if I make my bed in the depths, you are there. If I rise on the wings of the dawn, if I settle on the far side of the sea, even there your hand will guide me, your right hand will hold me fast.""

Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was fully God.   
Joh 1:14  Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father."
2126,"Why dies God not condone slavery in the old testament bible?

 My intent with this question is not to cause unnecessary provocation, but seek understanding. How can a loving God give us such rules:

“Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.
Exodus 21:20‭-‬21 NIV

https://bible.com/bible/111/exo.21.20-21.NIV

I'm sure the transatlantic slave trade was fueled by people who fundamentally believed in this text citing ownership of other humans. Yet how can we own one another if we are made in the image of God. I then read the new testament and see either what is: a rewriting of the law, or a conflict in the bible. 


There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
Galatians 3:28 NIV

https://galatians.bible/galatians-3-28

I'm simply seeking the truth. Thanks in advance."
2128,"I need advice. I have an account on X (formerly known as Twitter), and wanted to bring some Christian discussion into it. So, what I did was, I started making short videos (generally between 3-10 minutes) of me reading certain scriptural verses. And I would use my editing software to include the printed text in the video. And I would tag some of my friends who I knew were believers. 

For instance, my first topic was self-righteousness. Which is the one sin that Jesus spoke about more than any other. So, it's very easy to find some good verses. Just take a concordance and look up the word ""Pharisee,"" and you'll find plenty of examples.

But I chose Isaiah 65:2,3 (to ;), 5 and John 8:1-11, King James Version. The video would consist of the text of these scriptures, with me giving a voiceover.

Then as time went on, these videos got a little longer. And I would include an even longer one on Sundays. And I would do these every day. Today's, for instance, was seven minutes long. 

The problem is, I tagged my friends because I wanted some discussion out of it. I thought perhaps they would share some insight into a particular scripture I read, perhaps suggest another scripture I could have used, suggested a topic for me, or even offer to do some of these presentations themselves. But even though I've sent hints and DMs to my friends, none of them have engaged with my content in any way, beyond some likes.

Consequently, I'm not getting anything out of this. I wanted some fresh insight or ideas. I wanted to learn from this, but they refuse to engage in any discussion. They seem to like them, at least. One of them, for instance, tells me he listens to them first thing in the morning. Another one tells me he listens to it on the way to work. (If only these people would deign to reply in some way.)

But I just don't want to do it anymore. They refuse to engage. There's no sharing of ideas or discussion. Just me reading verses. Since they're not sharing, I figure I might as well stop and study on my own. Since they don't want to share any insights they have, why even bother making these videos? I could save time which I could use to study on my own. At least then, I might learn something. "

Ezekiel 1:20  

20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 

Ezekiel 10:9-13 

9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.
10 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.
11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.
12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.
13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O wheel.

His legs, his arms, forearms, face, chest, hair, eyes, voice, EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM IS JUST SO FUCKIN HOT. And that is my problem. I wanna kiss him all over, hold him, & and make him feel good.

2137,"I have been watching a lot of Christopher Hitchens arguments and I, as a christian, have a few questions I can't find an answer to myself. I prayed to God to guide me to find answers but I either didn't notice it or God didn't give me the chance. So, here are the questions:

-We learn God is all powerful, yet it seems like He isn't all knowing sometimes, like before the flood as God regretted making humanity. This isn't exactly a question and I don't think anyone knows how God's power works, but I just can't wrap my head around the fact that he can regret his actions....

- According to the timeline, humans are 6000 years old, yet science prooves that humans are actually around 100-400 thousand years old as a species. If Adam and Eve appeared 300 000 years ago, doesn't that mess the Bible's timeline up?

-For a long part of humanity's history, we suffered a lot. Diseases, teeth issues, a lot of children dying at birth. Why would God allow that?

-What are the consequences of homossexuality? If the bible wasn't mistranslated nor is it refering to a certain context, what are the consequences of being gay that makes it a sin?

- Why would God allow slavery? Even if there were rules for it, still I don't think anyone should be anyone's property besides God's.

God has changed my life a lot, to the better. The fact that I have these questions does not mean I don't believe and follow him, yet the strongest believer in my eyes, is an informed one.
That you for reading.

Edit: spelling."
2138,"I started writing this and realized my questions in the law were way too long so I’ve made two posts to separate them :P 

Hi everyone, so a little about me (30f) - I grew up (from 6 months old) in a cult where we claimed to be the “true” descendants of the biblical Israelites and so we kept the law and I’d say on the surface it was more similar to Judaism. We celebrated all the holy days, kept kosher, all the Old Testament things. We also were extremely anti-Christianity and saw it as the devils religious control on earth. When I was 22 I realized it was a cult and left, it was a tough year for me and I started leaning into witchcraft and the occult - I figured because all other religions were fake about their worshiping the devil I might as well go straight for the tarot cards because at least it’s authentic in its “badness.” That then lead to full out atheism after another terrible year about a year or two ago, where I didn’t believe believe in anything that wasn’t physical. 

Somewhere between full out witchcraft and atheism I reached out to a former cult member (I didn’t know him previously) who had a YouTube video out talking about how he left the cult and became a Christian! I was inspired by him and decided to reach out and he taught me about the gospel and I knew the love that Jesus taught was what was missing from my life and while I was talking to him I was getting closer to it and it was amazing. Eventually, I think my questions got to be too much on him and we stopped chatting. I didn’t really have anyone else to ask questions to, and I was still scared to go to a church and the immediate gratification of living sinfully just became too attractive so I went back to my bad ways.

My depression started getting out of hand again recently as I’ve been unemployed since March due to strikes impacting my industry, luckily I’ve been fine financially so I used that time for soul searching. I got into Jordan Peterson which led to finding more conservative creators and I found many views to be grounding, stable and attractive. Between these creators though, they sometimes debate the differences of their Christian denominations and that cleared up a whole lot for me in realizing not all Christians have the same beliefs by far. I’m the most interested now in Catholicism because of its longstanding authority but I still have questions. 

So for Catholicism specifically, the major questions most have like “why pray to Mary?” “Call no man father” idk there’s a bunch I’ve found reasonable answers to, but I still have a hard time getting past those things.

For Protestant religions, I have a hard time with sola scriptura because the Bible obviously does have contradictions that you have to use reason to figure out and it’s not clear to me how those decisions are made.

Here are some of the questions I have generally speaking, if you can answer one or any I’d really appreciate the insight: 

If sola scriptura - why worship on Sunday?

Do Jewish people who accept Jesus as the messiah need to keep the mosaic laws?

What happens when we die? Why is there a judgment day if everyone is judged to go to heaven or hell before judgement day?  Is the Kingdom of Heaven the same as Heaven? (My cult taught they were different and that no one could go to heaven unless they came from heaven, from my research that position is only backed up by John 3:13. I was taught we rest until judgment day when we die)

Revelations and Isaiah refer to the seven spirits of God. How does that factor into the Trinity?

How do you receive the comforter (Holy Spirit)?

Does everyone have a spiritual gift? How can I engage with mine through God(or the Holy Spirit?)? 

Do you think any of these questions don’t matter at all and are, in themselves, a stumbling block I’m adding to myself due to a lack of understanding of God?"

2142,"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said,

2144,"Trevor from Belief It Or Not did a video essay about this a year or two ago, but given what’s happened in my life recently, I wanna take a crack at it. 

Basically, it all came at once. My cat died, a close family member got sick, my internship ended with no job at the end, health insurance drama, car repairs. Even as recently as last year, I’d see it as the universe balancing itself out after a quiet and successful summer, or my personal persecution complex (possibly left over from my Christian days). Some might even say I had unrepentant sin. 

But after 7 months of good mental health, 18 months of sobriety, and a lot of therapy, it’s easy to believe now that these are just bumps in the road. The fact is, there’s hope. I have taught myself to believe that there always is. I still believe I can become a millionaire by age 50 as long as I work at it. I believe I can have a condo on the cape, that I can keep the summer home in the family, and that I can fulfill my dreams of traveling. 

And I’ve come to this point without believing in any gods, much less the Christian one. Christians would have you believe that there is no hope or even life outside of their bubble. That their way is the only way. After the wonderful experiences I had this summer, I can definitively say that this is not true."

2149,I’m curious on whether anyone has any biblical text on if God considers the trauma we endure as kids that might affect the way we’re wired and cause us to be heavily enticed by certain sins. For example if a father payed for his son to have sexual relations with prostitutes at a young age. Would God have more understanding towards that person since it was something he was taught in his developmental stages or would he look at you in a disgusted way either way. I understand God is holy and can’t stand sin just wonder if those unfortunate life events are taken into consideration.

2158,"Prayer based on Romans 5:6-11

God reconciles the ungodly and gives them the ministry of reconciliation. (2 Corinthians 5:18)

Father, we praise You and rejoice in who You are and what You have done. You chose to love us while we were Your enemies.
We were all without strength and enemies of You. To lay down your life for a good man is one thing, but Jesus showed us a much greater love by laying down his life for His enemy. Lord, You have done what no other man could do! You took the initiative and reconciled the ungodly! You justified us by Your blood and took the wrath the we deserve! May we see this truth and tremble when we think about where we would be apart from Your saving and sustaining grace. We are what we are by Your Grace!
Father, As we meditate on how You have shown such great love to such great sinners, may we be overwhelmed by Your grace and be conformed to Your image, have a greater appreciation for what You have done, and a greater desire to serve You and the lost. Empower us to be as kind to the wicked as You are. (Luke 6:35-36) Let us extend to others the mercy and grace You have extended to us. (2 Corinthians 5:18) And may our kindness be like Yours and lead others to repentance. May we glorify You in all we do and say, for You are Worthy!!! Amen.
Questions for reflection and meditation:
1.	Under what circumstances have you doubted the love of God for you?
2.	Are your beliefs shaped  by the Word of God or buy something else.
3.	Where do you receive good counseling and teaching?
4.	How often do you rejoice in and testify to the goodness of God in your life? (Psalm 145:4-6)
5.	If you were asked about the goodness of God to you this past week, what would you tell them?
6.	When was the last time you showed kindness to an enemy?"

2160,"When I find myself feeling overwhelmed, believing I don't have enough money, or when I feel harassed, sleep-deprived, overworked, misunderstood, out of place, or overly stressed, I reflect on 2 Corinthians 11:23-27 as a reminder of what it truly means to serve the Lord. 

2Co 11:23-27  Are they servants of Christ? (I am talking like I am out of my mind!) I am even more so: with much greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with more severe beatings, facing death many times. Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with a rod. Once I received a stoning. Three times I suffered shipwreck. A night and a day I spent adrift in the open sea. I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers from false brothers, in hard work and toil, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, many times without food, in cold and without enough clothing. "

Also if you want to have children of your own you can still do since you have the ability to reproduce and have sex. So I see it as a win.

2166,"*If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraids not; and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering (James 1:5-6)*

It's not about being wise, it's about receiving the necessary wisdom and instruction in the present moment.

I received a lot of wisdom over the past year, because I desired it, asked God for it, read His Word and meditated on how His Word applies to my life. I also spent a lot of time in isolation. I can only bring some wisdom to mind though, because none of it belongs to me. God gives and God takes. If I were to go around thinking that wisdom is my own, I would surely fall, because God hates pride. If I were walking around in pride thinking that I am wise, God would likely choose to withhold His wisdom from me.

*Do you see a person wise in their own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for them. (Prov 26:12)*

Wisdom is only useful if it can be applied in the present moment. God will only present His wisdom to our attention if we are walking in humility, understanding that wisdom is not our own, but a gift from God, that can be taken away. 

Wisdom that we were given in the past is not guaranteed to be in the front our minds when we need it. However, when we constantly view ourselves as needy children of the Most High God YHWH, and continually seek His wisdom in the present moment, we will receive exactly what we need. 

*Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you: For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it will be opened. (Matt 7:7-8)*

Wisdom comes from the Most High God YHWH. It does not matter how much knowledge or experience we think we have. All that matters is this present moment. When we stay in focused in the present moment and take the time to seek God and His specific wisdom that we need right now, we will be delivered from evil, and prosper in peace.

*Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.*

*For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.*

*She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.*

*Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.*

*Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.*

*She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retains her.*

*YHWH by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has He established the heavens.*

*By His knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.*

*My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:*

*So will they be life to your soul, and grace to your neck.*

*Then you will walk in your way safely, and your foot will not stumble. (Prov 3:13-23)*"

I am helping a group to set up a new Chrysalis community and am want to hear from people. I want to know what issues people had with Chrysalis/Walk to Emmaus. I have found out in researching on social media that some people feel it can be strange, cultish, or even drove them away from church altogether.

2177,"So I've been a hardcore christian for a while now ( I went to the extent of making a discord server to bring people to christianity) And recently I'm starting to strongly doubt God's existence because of a simple reason: unanswered prayers.

I prayed for God to help me out by giving me visions, because that would give me a testimony to use to help me explain to people why I believe so strongly in God (my whole family is agnostic) I'm not someone who jumps to conclusion, so if God gave me a vision I would carefully analyse it. I waited about a month, praying about it often and, nothing. But I thought to myself whatever there must be a good reason he's not answering my prayer. Then recently I lost my pencil case with a scientific calculator and other important stuff, so I had to buy a new one with new equipment, 3 days later I lose that one as well, I checked EVERYWHERE, asked everybody to see if they took it by mistake, went to the lost and found about a bazillion times. I didn't feel like spending 50+ euros again, so I asked God to please allow me to find it, and, NOTHING, there is no reason why this prayer should go unanswered, it isn't in anyway against God's will, it isn't something that isn't possible to do, It's not helping me in any way and it's just making me seriously doubt God's existence. It may sound silly but there is clearly written in the bible so many times that you may ask and receive, knock and it shall be opened. I prayed with faith and believed that I would find it, so it wasn't a faith problem....please someone help me."
2178,"Genesis says that God flooded the world because he REGRETTED creating humanity. Regretted? As in “Well, gosh, if I had only known how it would have turned out, I never would have done it.”?

And there’s the Passover story. God hardens the Pharoah’s heart. That is, God interferes with the Pharoah’s free will so that the Pharaoh refuses to let the Hebrews leave Egypt. Then God punishes all the people of Egypt with a swarm of frogs. God hardens the Pharoah’s heart again. God punishes with a lice infestation. Harden; wild animals into the cities. Harden; a disease that kills domestic animals. Harden; painful boils. Harden; fire and ice. Harden; a plague of locust. Finally, harden, then kill the firstborn child of each and every Egyptian. It’s like God is torturing the Egyptian people like a sick little boy tortures a helpless animal.

Then there’s the birth of Jesus. God sends a star that leads the wise men to Jerusalem, where they tell evil Herod about the birth of a king. Then the star leads them to Jesus. God tells the wise men not to return to Herod. God tells Mary and Joseph to take Jesus and flee to Egypt. But God doesn’t tell Herod not to kill the little boys under two. None of this would not have happened if God didn’t send a star, or if the star had led the wise men to straight to Jesus instead of Jerusalem.

The first thing Jesus does in the Bible is to stay behind in Jerusalem when he is twelve years old. His parents return and spend three days searching for him. ""And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? Behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.” (Luke 2:48) Abandoning your parents without warning is not a nice thing to do.

Lastly, Jesus says “Just as Jonah was in the belly of the whale three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights” in Matthew 12:40. But he only stays in the ground for two nights. And he told the “good thief” that TODAY you will be with me in paradise.

There’s more, like Jesus cursing the fig tree or Matthew 15:1-4. It often seems the Bible is a bunch of silly stories that often make no sense."

Satan quotes it while tempting Jesus: he says:

At least for God to show himself to me or give me signs on what I can do to heal but NOTHING. Things are just getting worse. Why does he want us to suffer? Why did he create our bodies to be so flawed and full of disease and suffering? I feel angry. Really angry. I dont know what to do I dont wanna feel this way but I do
2186,"There’s a thought that I’ve had for a long time. Basically we are all born atheist. We are not born with the knowledge of God/Jesus/Christianity/Satan/etc. Then basically people tell us about all these things and then we either become Christians or whatever religon we are born into or we don’t. Or we lose faith or change faiths or come back to faith etc. But I think it’s strange that we aren’t all born with the knowledge of God if he’s the ultimate truth.   So a person can live and die without ever being told about God and Jesus.

Edit:  I’m defining atheist as a lack of belief in a God. There are a bunch of comments that are defining atheist different ways. This is how I’m defining it and I definitely didn’t believe in any God or Gods until I was taken to church and was told about Christianity. Maybe I’m weird that way, I dunno.

2188,"1) Is the Word of God in the Bible? No. It's in the Bible AND in all of reality -- the universe and history. To say that it is in the Bible is to reduce the Creator of the world to the author of a book. Creation precedes the Bible temporally and logically. One cannot be interpreted without the other. When God said ""Fiat lux!"", light was made everywhere. When you read the same words in the Bible, sometimes it doesn't even make light in your empty head. 

2) God is not limited by the objective consequences of his previous actions, but the matter on which he operates -- reality -- is. This is why the question of ""determinism versus free will"" is not a serious philosophical problem. The determined and the undetermined will be intermingled in the body of reality for centuries to come."

2192,"Yooo whaddup 25M here with high functioning autism.  I was thinking about the absolute depressing state of my life a few days ago and I’ve been looking up statistics for people with autism spectrum disorder.  Apparently my kind only have an average lifespan of 54-58 years.  We’re 9x more likely to kill ourselves.  Only 5% of us will attain a successful marriage, but apparently we have a higher desire for love/romance, which essentially means a shitload of us are desperate incels and will remain that way our whole lives.  We’re more prone to depression, anxiety, and all kinds of other disorders that interfere with our ability to be social.  Everybody always talks about kids with autism because they’re in the public eye, but nobody talks about the adults because (from what I can tell) they all either hang themselves or slowly withdraw from society, living alone and miserable.  ASD people like myself are also prone to hypersexuality, which means we masturbate a lot more and get fucked up porn addictions.  This is something I’ll admit I struggle with to the point where it affects my finances.  I have no friends, no girlfriend, and will likely never have any money.  I’ll work some shit job up until I’m in my 50s and die without ever getting to retire or enjoy life even a little, assuming I haven’t already blown my brains out by then.

So I was thinking… why the fxck does God decide to make some people this way?  I get it, different communities and marginalized groups suffer from all kinds of different issues unique to their groups, and that suffering “allows people to become stronger” or “find their passions” or “create lasting bonds with others”… at least normally.  But us autists on the other hand have no ability to perform random basic life tasks, much less can we ever thrive socially.  Things aren’t just gonna magically turn around for us.  No matter how hard my people try to push forward, life won’t get any better for us.  We won’t be able to overcome our shit in the same way that people with other problems can.  So why?  Why was I given life?  I sure as shit have never been happy and and don’t have a chance in hell of ever making that happen.  Why would God be so heartless and cruel?  

I know this is quite the whiny post here, but I’m not looking for people to baby me on this.  Just be honest and straight with me here - was I created just to suffer?  Am I the great punchline for everyone to laugh at?  Don’t worry about offending me, just be real & tell me the truth."

The other renewed the Gospel Faith by his radical piety and simple obedience to the Church. This humble reformer is Francis of Assisi. One is a saint, the other is an excommunicate. 

St. Francis shows us that we cannot change the world by our own activism and innovations, but only by holiness; and holiness is simply being united to Christ who is “the way, the truth, and the life” (Jn 14:6). During His Passion, God did not establish His Kingdom through worldly power, but through the power of truth and self-abasing love. This is how we must witness to the Faith, even with all the filth in God’s Holy Church, by a spirit of humility, penance, and prayer in conformity with the crucified Christ. It is faith and obedience that win out in the end.

# Inspired By John 4*43 - 54

There is a big contrast between the Samaritans Christ left behind in Sychar and the Galileans He would visit next.  The Samaritans believed in Christ because of His message alone.  They needed no signs and wonders, as did their next door neighbors, the Galileans.  Christ preferred the Samaritan approach: they heard and they believed.

The Galileans knew of Christ’s activities while at the feast in Jerusalem.  They welcomed Him with open arms because of what they had seen before.  It’s within this setting the noble asked Jesus to make the marathon journey from Cana to Capernaum to heal his son.  That’s quite the bold request!  

“Will You walk for 7 to 10 hours to heal my dying son?”  

If the son was about to die… he may have died before their journey’s end.  Throughout the gospels and Acts it seems as though walking was the primary form of transportation.  Google maps shows the stretch of today’s paved roads and freeways between the two cities is a marathon’s distance apart: a little over 26 miles.

This conversation took place in the early afternoon (see v. 52 - 53).  I do not know if people traveled during hours of darkness.  If they left immediately, they may have reached Capernaum before nightfall.  At the very least, I would not start a marathon stroll without being well provisioned for the journey if I intended to travel nonstop.

Christ responded to the noble, but His comment targeted all who were within range to hear His words.  His reply, in contemporary parlance:

“If not for the signs and wonders **all y’all** see, not at all will **all y’all** believe.”

Signs and wonders are evidence.  Signs confirm, corroborate, and or authenticate the one displaying the sign.   Wonders are the supernatural events that leave lasting impressions on the spectators.  They become evidence that warrants, merits, or justifies the belief.  The more educated and intelligent the person, the greater the craving and clamoring for signs & wonders and evidence & knowledge.

Faith gets choked out when the quest for knowledge and evidence increases.  Again, knowledge and intelligence could very well be the arch nemesis of faith.  They demand their proofs **before** belief in Christ is attained.  Without signs and wonders, the intelligentsia have no reason or desire to believe in Christ.  At best, their belief is in what was done more so than the One who done it.  So…  they really are not in league with Christ.

Faith is the ability and willingness to believe when signs & wonders are insufficient and evidence & knowledge are incomplete (Hebrews 11\*1).  True faith comes from the inside out; it requires no additional external stimulus once I accept and believe in Christ’s greatest deed already accomplished on the cross… a sign and wonder I will never witness. I have no evidence beyond God’s Word.  I have no knowledge beyond what I find in the Word of God.  Nor can I provide evidence of my saintly status that comes from God through Christ’s death on the cross.  I cannot put forth enough knowledge and evidence (nor signs and wonders) to convince another of the gracious mercies God blesses me with every single day.  All I possess is the gospel of Christ in its simplicity.  The song, “Great Things” says it quite well:

“Oh, hero of Heaven, You conquered the grave

You free every captive and break every chain

Oh God, You have done great things…”

Do you believe in Him because of Him alone?  

Are you still waiting and searching for that one illusive piece of evidence that confirms, corroborates, and or authenticates Christ as your Lord and Redeemer?

As always, I’d love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

1. if aliens are real do they worship God?
2. is there validity to native americans being lost tribes of Israel?
3. if Muslims, Jews, and Christians all worship the same God, the only difference being Jesus, is it possible God knew humans would never agree on 1 religion so appears differently for all to save as many souls as he can?
4. elaborating on the above - all religions have alleged encounters with God - why is this?

2231,"* Commonly abused passage:
> You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22)

* Passage understood in context:
> For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, “Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them.” Now it is evident that no man is justified before God by the law; for “He who through faith is righteous shall live”;* but the law does not rest on faith, for “He who does them shall live by them.” Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us—for it is written, “Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree” (Galatians 3:10-13)

> Since all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)

> For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Now to one who works, his wages are not reckoned as a gift but as his due. And to one who does not work but trusts him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to whom God reckons righteousness apart from works: “Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not reckon his sin.” (Romans 4:2-8)

> For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God— not because of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9)

> For we hold that a man is saved by faith alone, apart from works of law. (Romans 3:28)"
2232,"So I don't know why I am posting this, I'm fed up at the moment. I regret a lot of the things that I've done in the past, I can't even have a good day without thinking about what I did. Even the things that made me happy or made me realize that life isn't such a bad thing doesn't work. I'm mad because I've tried to ask God about something but He won't listen to me. I've asked Him but each time, I'm confused about it. So it's not God because He isn't the author of confusion. 

I don't know if I deliberately sinned to the point where I can't be forgiven but here I am. I don't know if I have faith but regardless, I have to get baptized. I asked about it and I told them that I was baptized as a child. They told me that I was baptized because the baptism isn't something that we do, but God does. Now, I heard that being baptized as a child is useless because it isn't mentioned in the bible. So what do I do? 

After what I did, which was backsliding, disobeying, repeating my sin, etc. I don't think that I have a lot of time left to live. I don't know but I can't help it. Had God listened to me, I could've avoided a lot of damage to myself by not choosing to sin as a form of distraction."
2233,"Let no man deceive you with empty words, for because of such things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.7 Therefore, do not be sharers with them;8 for you were once darkness, but you are now light in connection with the Lord. Go on walking as children of light,9 for the fruitage of the light consists of every sort of goodness and righteousness and truth.10 Keep on making sure of what is acceptable to the Lord;11 and stop sharing in the unfruitful works that belong to the darkness; rather, expose them for what they are.12 For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention.

hi, everyone, I have a question the scripture above orders me to expose sin. the corner description of the sub says it's to discuss aspects of Christian life and all are welcome. which is totally cool and appropriate.

I'm concerned that the aspects of Christianity others might take as bigotry or harassment during these confusing times. even though the commands are listed i could post a scripture that could get me banned for doing what the corner description states i can do and my religion requires me to do, per scripture. 

so, I would appreciate some guidance on this because Christianity is not about unity or acceptance and to quote our king. 

""“Everyone, then, who acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father who is in the heavens.33 But whoever disowns me before men, I will also disown him before my Father who is in the heavens.34 **Do not think I came to bring peace to the earth; I came to bring, not peace, but a sword.35 For I came to cause division, with a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.36 Indeed, a man’s enemies will be those of his own household**.37 Whoever has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and whoever has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me.38 And whoever does not accept his torture stake and follow after me is not worthy of me.""

I'm sorry if I offend people but I'm confused the corner says a place to discuss Christianity, but it appears people don't actually know what that is or what is written in the bible. 

i keep getting accused of having my own opinions even though I'm just cutting and pasting from the bible. 

people are aware you must follow someone in order to be considered a follower of them, so I'm very confused when people can't provide me a scripture to prove me wrong as a Christian and i find that very troubling considering there are 380k of you on this sub.

i guess what I'm saying is, is this a place for Christianity or just satire? cause i can't change the rules of the faith to fit your particular life because technically we are supposed to adjust to gods way not what makes people happy. divorce, war, not looking out for enemies, violence, lgbtq is completely forbidden and written many times in the bible but if i post the scriptures I'm a bigot. not logical cause censorship is another form of controlling the real story and not loving to our fellow man to lie to them just to make them feel better.

Now we know that the Law is fine if one applies it properly,9 recognizing that law is made, not for a righteous man, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, ungodly and sinners, disloyal and profane, murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, manslayers,10 sexually immoral people, men who practice homosexuality, kidnappers, **liars**, perjurers, and everything else that is in opposition to the wholesome teaching

Why does God only love me for things I hate instead of loving me for my personality?!! Why is He so serious all the time?!!! Why does He hate who I am??? Because I'm flawed and not perfect??? Because I'm a retard??!!! Because I'm a piece of shit???!!!!!! I'm just screaming into the void. Know I probably won't like the answers. If anyone cares.

2236,"I've grown up Christian, and I felt that the second most important thing to look forward to in life was getting married. I watched all the cringey romance cartoons growing up, I've had crushes here and there, but I didn't actually start dating until college. I'm told that I am attractive, and I've gotten the attention of some very attractive men. So I thought that finding a husband would be a breeze. When I got to college, I got lots of attention, just not from good guys...

The first guy was an atheist, and we dated for three years. He did not treat me well at all, and my inexperienced self thought that was okay. I helped him become Christian, but he decided later on to dump me in a very cruel way. I still get flashbacks of how he treated me. The second boyfriend wasn't Christian either, but he got deployed after I helped him come to Christ too. He was the ""right person wrong time"" trope. The third boyfriend claimed to be a Christian, but he was a spoiled brat. 

So now I'm single, 25 years old, and heading off to air force basic training soon, so I will be gone for six months. That's six months that I could be using to network and meet people. When I get back, I will be in the National Guard, so I can stay home instead of go on rotations. I just moved to ""the big city"" three months ago, and I've been attending like four church gatherings a week, trying to meet women to befriend and men to possibly date. To be honest, I'm secretly hoping that I meet a guy who would be willing to wait for me until after I get back from Basic. 

I am afraid that despite all these church gatherings, despite how ""attractive"" I am, I've failed to meet my deadline to find a good husband, and I will be alone forever. My high school class of 18 people are mostly married now, and I feel like I'm left behind. I mean, how many mid-twenty males are left? How many of them would I actually find attractive, and make good husbands? I still get approached, but it's only by guys I don't find attractive or have repulsive personalities. Guys I do find attractive I get nervous around, and can't reciprocate my interest. I feel like life has passed me by, and I should just give up on my dream to be a wife and mother.

How likely is it that I will be single forever? "

2239,"Why do mainstream Christians criticize Mormons for their practice of polygamy when there are multiple examples of God blessing men who had multiple women? (I’m not Mormon.) And not only did they have multiple wives, but concubines, as well. 

“And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.” 1 Kings 11:3

Lot’s wife looked back at her home while it burned and was immediately punished by being turned to salt. These men were not punished for their polygamy, so I can see why Mormons would think it’s ok.

But sometimes I wonder ..I’ve been kind of straying away from the faith.. I recently saw a tiktok about guy who wants evidence of God and I felt like could not stand in that. Like part of me believes but maybe who I think God is,  is not what I was taught or learned via Christian teaching and sermons.

It doesn’t help that a seed/concern was planted regarding .. like I don’t get why Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins. I think I can get why though how him being raised from there dead is important but understanding the importance of the blood of Jesus and how his death atoned for our sins I don’t get . I read somewhere that maybe God just did that because during that time period it’s what people needed to feel right with God .. 

Well I say this all to ask can anyone or does anyone believe or rather “know”God exists without a shadow of a doubt? Like does anyone 100% know/believe. Like I sort of but it’s  kind of wishy washy. And also it has to do what resources Ive been listening to 

I can’t even lie and say that I haven’t been carried about by the worries of this world so that probably explains why I haven’t found the certainty ( word bearing fruit I guess)

Will have story so if you want to cut to now go to the other paragraph

I grew up in what I was told a non practicing non-denominational Christian household I grew up being told about God sometimes and was asked to pray in certain times but other then that religion was never brought up so I was raised in a household with a loose Christian faith. For a short period of time less then a year my parents started going to church I didn't remember much except they had no chairs in there room and they were meant to take there own Bible. Me and other kids were taken to a another part of the church to play outside eat snacks and spend time listening to Bible stories that I mostly took as just stories (as of now respectfuly still do) and I was also told Jesus loves us and died for our sins. I believed in christ up until about early 6th grade in middle school I became a atheist mostly because of family issues, my loose faith was overwhelmed with doubts and everyone around me who spoke of religion was atheist and was claiming it was all fake. From 6th to 9th I was atheist I didn't believe in God despite this the occasional times I heard Christian and the rare moments I Jewish gospel and teachins I felt a powerful emotion like no other and it felt exactly like a presence but I brushed it off. In 9th grade I started to question the atheist beliefs and how this is chance and absolutely worthless and were just flesh that happens to have complex thoughts and emotions. 9th grade was also hard as hurricanes uprooted my life and I was failing school which some would think would make me doubt the idea of atheist being wrong even more but it didn't and it may have  made me more skeptical of being atheist. Soon after I declared myself no longer atheist but not faithful to any religion but religiously lost at first I thought nothing of it but it quickly backfired as I started questioning everything and life purpose. During this time I was very open about being lost and I had atheist and Christians trying to help me I also saw Christian Jewish and atheist content online.




Ok now to the present in 10th 


During this time when I was hearing people talk of religion and looking at religious things online I started paying attention to that feeling and I decided to take it for what it feels like a presence and slowly came to a point where I knew I was ethier an atheist or a Christian and started looking into both. Yesterday I really thought about it and started thinking about both atheism and Christianity and threw challenges at both with each one I always seemed to have a perfect response for Christianitys defense that I thought made sense and for atheist beliefs I ethier couldn't come back with anything or anything I thought made sense. I also looked at Christian YouTube videos and online content and I felt the presence again but this time it was calming and felt incorporated into the moment rather then being the whole moment. I think I might be Christian again but am still in between Christianity and atheism trying to figure out what is right. I feel like Christianity is right but doubt and my past tell me we live in a Godless universe. 


I guess I just don't know.

2246,"In the Bible, it says you become ""one flesh"" in the means when you have sex with your partner. As a Christian, what do you think that sex standard is?

2247,"I am a Christian, struggling, but still a Christian. I have been fascinated by psychedelic substances for the last few years, though I have not yet partaken. Frankly, I see no issue with mushrooms, or other psychedelic “drugs” from a libertarian perspective, and I would appreciate biblical perspective as to why Christians should not use these substances. They have been shown to heal various mental conditions, are non-habit forming, impossible to overdose on, and open areas of your brain, including spiritual areas, that are impossible to tap into without said substance.

But recently when I was talking about some verses while she was cooking she yelled at me to stop and called me a hardcore christian. How exactly can you be hardcore for loving god and talking about him? Is that not the same thing as calling someone a health freak for eating healthy food? Someone pls tell me what I did wrong because she refuses to talk about it."
2249,"I have seen the rise of universalism and denominations that preach everyone will be saved in Christ, or that there is no hell and such. Christians who claim that those of us who believe in eternal damnation for the unbeliever believe in a hateful and spiteful God as opposed to their loving and kind God. This is aimed towards them in a hopefully objective and respectful way. I don't personally want to attack anyone but show what we believe. This is the heart of Lutheranism, a shortened explanation of it..

We believe in a just God who takes sin very serious. He is just and holy and righteous. The Lord must payback every evil against him in the world, for if he didn't God would no longer be just and holy. God would no longer be God. He cannot forget sin, for it is not in his very nature. Stories which show this include the Flood, the conquest of the Promised Land, the building of the Tabernacle and its holy spaces, Day of Atonement, and the Levitical Code, and many more.

In Matthew 5:48, we are told a hard truth for humans to come to grip with. Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect. IT says be perfect, not become perfect. Through original sin, we are all born sinful and hateful towards God. We all have failed to live up to his holiness, and deserve death and hell. 

Yet God didn't want to punish was for our sins. Yet he can't let evil go unpunished, so he sent his son Jesus Christ to live the perfect life and fulfill His law in our place. Jesus didn't deserve death and Hell, but that is what was given to him upon the cross. He suffered the punishment we all deserve. IF you think the Old Testament God was ""cruel and wicked"" as opposed to the New Testment one, well this suffering of the Innocent One is just as brutal. Yet God punished himself in Our place. Thanks to jesus, we receive his rightousness, which covers our sins and brings us into a right relationship with God. 

In Hebrews 10:14 we are told Jesus sacrifice has perfected us. Through faith imparted by the Holy Spirit God now sees us as his perfect Children. We have been redeemed at a price with blood. We did nothign to earn it, it is entirely a gift of God. Now as his children, we have the express joy to do good deeds, not because we have to, but because we love to thank God our father in heaven for what he has done to us. It is joy to do loving acts with not strings attached, no rewards. Serving the Lord is the reward. Heaven is ours.

If you downplay God's law, justice, and holiness, then you make Jesus' sacrifice and God's love worthless too. It is a hard message, that we deserve hell and there is nothign we can do to earn forgiveness. Yet that truly Makes God's love, that he would give up his life to save people who could offer him absolutely nothing in return, shine ever more bright. I always say hit them hard with the law, but hit them harder with the Gospel. They go hand in hand. "
2250,"I’m a 16 year old guy who goes to a small high school. I don’t find anyone at this school worth dating because I’ve decided that if I’m gonna date somebody it’s gonna be for marriage, not just messing around, because it’s a dream of mine to have a family centered around God. I want to be truly happy in a relationship, not chasing temporary pleasure that doesn’t last long. I’ve tried to explain this to my friends, but for some reason they can’t understand and think it’s impossible that I don’t want to have a relationship with someone at my school and they have been teasing me and now genuinely thinking that I’m gay because of this, just because I’m traditional? I honestly don’t know how I’m supposed to explain this to them and I’ve tried multiple times but they always just end up thinking I’m secretly gay or something, and it’s getting frustrating because that’s becoming all they wanna talk about now for some reason, like they are so invested in my personal life."
2252,"What does exodus 3:13 say, and what does it mean?

What it says.

Exodus 3:13 says, “Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”

What it means to a christian

 In this passage, Moses is asking God what name he should use when speaking to the Israelites about God.

What does exodus 3:14 say, and what does it mean?

What it says

Exodus 3:14 is a verse from the Bible in which God reveals his name to Moses. It reads, ""God said to Moses, “I am who I am. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”

What it means to a Christian 

 This verse is often interpreted to mean that God is the self-existent, eternal, and unchanging being who is the source of all life and existence.

Me, confused

But doesnt it just mean that he is giving his literal name to moses, as this was what was asked by moses?

No, Exodus 3:14 does not mean that ""I am who I am"" is the literal name of God. This phrase is a declaration of God's self-existence and His unchanging nature. It is not a literal name, but rather a statement of His character.

What does exodus 3:15 say, and what does it mean?

What it says

Exodus 3:15 says, ""God also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘The Lord, the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever; this is how I am to be remembered in every generation.”

What it means to a christian

Exodus 3:15 is a declaration of God's eternal nature and His unchanging character. It is not a literal name, but rather a statement of His character. God is saying that He will always be the same, and that He will always be known by this declaration of His character. He is not giving Himself a literal name, but rather declaring His unchanging nature.

Hmmm im confused.

So what your saying is, Moses asked god for his name, and god avoided the question by telling moses about his character. Moses wants to know what to call god when being asked by the isrealites who sent him, and God tells moses to just tell them about Gods character. God did not mean ""tell them ""I am"" has sent you"" when they ask. Although thats what he literally said,  instead he meant for moses to tell the isrealites about the character of who sent him. Also, when god said ""this is the name i shall be known as for all of time to come"" he didnt really mean that literally either, instead he meant that his character would be that way forever?

I dunno....seems kinda off to me.

Im thinking he meant what he said, and gods actual name is I Am, and he demands to be known by this name forever.
(yet not many know this)
Am I wrong to think god and moses were both being literal in what they said in exodus 3:13-15?"

2255,"Good evening all,

Our family is taking part in a baby dedication for our 2 month old little girl at the end of October.  As part of the process, we’ve been asked to choose a life verse for our little girl.

The life verse is supposed to be a passage of Scripture that we feel like uniquely describes our individual child and/or one that we want to plant in their hearts. Once we’ve chosen a life verse for our child, we pray that verse over them constantly. When they are old enough we talk to them about what it means and help them memorize it.

My wife and I are certainly not bible scholars, so we’re resorting to asking trusted advisors for their feedback - google and Reddit users :)

Does anyone have any good suggestions for baby dedication verses?

Thank you in advance for your time and wisdom!"
2256,"How many kids do you have?

I have no fear of marriage (in fact, it’s the thing that I’ve always wanted and prayed for), but I am terrified of bearing children. I’m a young woman, and the thought of giving birth, of laboring, of being pregnant, of having a miscarriage - all of these things. I want *nothing to do* with child bearing. I’m willing to adopt and that’s basically it. 

So I’m wondering about a few things:

Are you male or female?
How many kids do you have?
Did you want that many kids? Do you want more?

Certain Christians believe that all birth control is sinful, do you agree? If so, why?

If couples are infertile, does that mean that God doesn’t want them to have children?
What does infertility mean? Is it medical or is it an act of God’s will? 
What does a miscarriage mean? Is it just physiological or is it an act of God’s will? What does this mean?
Can knowingly infertile people get marriage at all? 

I am not naturally inclined to have a particular desire for children of my own. “BuT cHiLdReN aRe a giFt FrOm tHe Lord” - yes. They are. I work with kids, i love children and I love the special sections of our hearts that they fill. But the christian romanticism of turning young women in to the image of “barefoot and pregnant” traditional “quiver-full” wives makes me *deeply uncomfortable*. I’m not a baby machine, and often times the spaces I grew up in liked to attribute the value of a woman with how many kids she could have. I know that that is baggage, but if it causes us to think about these things deeply…then I guess it’s worth it."

I would like some weight off my shoulders because it is all getting too much for me.

Two years ago before today I prayed hard for a baby boy after three girls and I’d lose myself if something happened to my baby boy.
2263,"I have been a believer since 2017 now. I have a very rough and abusive home-life and over the years it had caused me to have up and down attendance. 

However, my attendance has been regular now. 

Even then, whenever I mention being baptized (as a recommitment to my faith) the head pastor says, “have you repented” with what I think is, a questioning suspicious look. I said, “yes, Jesus is my lord and savior, he died on the cross to atone for my sins and I have repented for my sinful ways.”… then ensues a long spiel on how I have to come to saving faith, repent and be delivered (as if I’m not) from my sins. 

BUT every time I try to go to another church and I revisit them on Sundays they ask me, “where have you been?” “why’d you disappear on us, sister!” “We’re seeing you next week right?” 

Even the members have asked, “you’re not a member yet?”

I’ve prayed on it for months and God is urging me to go find an actual healthy church home. 

I feel like I’m being judged in some way by their leadership. This experience has made me feel like garbage. At this point, I’m ready to move on from this church. I love the members but leadership has always personally rubbed me the wrong way. Has this happened to anyone else? How do I go about moving on?"

2265,"So...the belief is that many people are just destined to go to Hell. And these people are going to Hell as a consequence of ""free will""...that is, they chose a life of sin and so therefore can't enter God's Kingdom. 

And the reason why God gave us ""free will"" is so that our ""love"" for him can ostensibly mean something, right?

But if His goal is to have all of his creations with him in Heaven, why does he let ""free will"" be a thing when he knows that doing so will inevitably lead to billions of souls being destined to an eternity of torment? 

If God truly so loves the world, that he created...why didn't he just create a universe and reality where we all will go to Heaven? I mean, if the eternal fate of my soul is on the line, I think I would rather have my decisions made for me so that I can be assured entrance into Heaven, as opposed to being left to my own human flaws to make mistakes and sin and therefore condemn myself to Hell.

Is the answer to this ""well He works in mysterious ways so we can't ever know"" or is there an answer that would actually make sense?"

2274,"Hi everybody. This is my first post ever and it might be a long one so I hope some of you guys stick around and read it. I have been struggling a while now with something and I would like to know if anyone has had any similar experiences.

In December of 2018, it was the night before my birthday and I decided to take shrooms. I had done them a few times before and because it was going into my birthday that night I thought why not go into my birthday on shrooms and have “fun”. (This is before I was saved). I took them and I invited my buddy and his girlfriend over to hangout while I was on them. While they were there it was just weird. Everything just felt off. After a couple of hours they left and I threw some YouTube on with some music and just started vibing. That weird feeling that I had was gone. 

As it gets closer to midnight and it being my birthday my brain started really thinking about my life and things that really mattered in life. Finally I started to think about Jesus and faith. I had always grown up around believers and I myself as a child always in my heart believed and knew that Jesus was real. But in that moment I realized that I never remembered actually accepting him into my life and praying the prayer of salvation. So that’s exactly what I did. I went to my room, got on my hands and knees and professed my love for Him and prayed for Jesus to come into my heart. 

At that moment everything with the “trip” seemed to change. I didn’t feel “messed up” from the shrooms anymore. I was still in that state but I felt “more normal” than I ever had while on mushrooms. Everything now looked cartoonish and the colors were more vibrant than they had ever been before when I took mushrooms. My focus was totally there and I had more peace and less worry in that moment than I had ever felt. The “trip” had completely changed after accepting Christ. After that I took mushrooms probably 3 times and each time I noticed the “trip” was exactly the same as the night when I was saved. They were nothing like the “trips” I had before I was saved where I just felt messed up and different. It was like getting saved changed something about how I felt and saw things while on mushrooms previous to being saved.

I know that’s a lot and I don’t even know if this is the right place to post this but one thing I do know is I for sure got saved that night and I love Jesus more than anything on this earth. It’s been about 4 years since I have done them. I know this will be hard for a lot of people in here to understand but I just would like to know if any Christians here have had any similar experiences?

For those who stuck around to read, thank you! Please no questioning of my faith because of my experiences. I know I am filled with the Holy Spirit. Thank you guys and God bless 😊"
2275,"**Gospel: Luke 10:1-12**

Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come. 2 And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest. 3 Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves. 4 Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way. 5 And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 6 And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again. 7 And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 9 and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. 10 But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, 11 Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh. 12 I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.

**\[Commentary\]**

As we discussed a week or so ago, it is interesting to learn that Jesus had followers other than just the twelve.  Most of us—when we thing of Christ’s ministry—form a mental picture of Jesus and the twelve traveling about preaching the gospel, healing the sick and casting out demons.  Indeed we have seen this image in art as well as even movies depicting the times of Christ.  But a closer study of the Gospels reveal a much different picture, so to speak.

Here we read that Jesus appointed 70 others to go out and preach the gospel, some versions of the Bible say 72, but none the less this account depicts a much greater effort than the one we find in Luke 9:1-6 when he sent out only the twelve.

Jesus commanded them to go with a certain kind of heart, trusting God and not seeking to abuse and manipulate others. Going as lambs among wolves doesn’t sound very attractive; yet, it was exactly how Jesus was sent, and how the power of God worked through Him mightily.

He told them to take no personal possessions, nothing that might be a distraction, and he forbade them to give greeting along the way.  Distractions that might take away from their mission were to be avoided including the tedious, full of flattery ritual greetings on the road.

He told them that when they entered a home where the host was providing them shelter during their mission in that village, they were to first say, “Peace be to this house” a blessing of peace over the home.  A “son of Peace” was a man of good report, a honorable man, if such lived in the home the blessing would be on him, if not the blessing would come back to the preacher.

Jesus told them to remain in the same house, eating and drinking such things as they give: They were to trust that God would provide for them through the generosity of others, and they were to thankfully receive what was offered to them – without begging from house to house.

He wanted them to heal the sick and tell them that the Kingdom of God had come near.  As part of healing the sick, they described what the kingdom of God was about from what Jesus had taught and shown them.

He told them that if a village or city did not welcome them, to go out and while wiping the dust from their feet they were to say ‘The very dust of your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near you.”  Their message and the evidence of the kingdom’s power was to be clear enough that they could say this publicly to a city that rejected them.

Those that hear the message of Christ, and then reject it forthwith can expect little tolerance and leeway on that final day.  In Luke 10:16 (CEV) Jesus says; “My followers, whoever listens to you is listening to me. Anyone who says “No” to you is saying “No” to me. And anyone who says “No” to me is really saying “No” to the one who sent me.  Are you willing to say “No” to God?"

I'm curious to hear your thoughts and insights on this topic. Specifically, I'd like to discuss historical instances of abuse, such as the Crusades, the Inquisition, colonialism, and others.

What are some historical abuses that you believe were committed in the name of Christianity?

How do you think these events have impacted the perception of Christianity both internally and externally?

What lessons can Christians, draw from these dark chapters in its history to ensure that such abuses are not repeated in the future?

What steps or initiatives have been taken within the Christian community to address and learn from these historical abuses?

they say: surely you love God more than your family? so prove it, and if u say that u love God more, we will kill them. however, say that u love ur family more, we will spare them.

there could be more that goes in, eg. they only kill u, but lets not think about that for a second.

2291,"Yo okay so a little backstory, went to a religious school, didn't really believe, but as I've been an adult I've acknowledged the presence of some sort of higher being, just don't know who got it right, but I do know I've always been looked out for, and have had thoughts/feelings to begin reading the bible, praying, etc.   


But today, I was driving to my bjj gym, to help with kids class, and I was going down-hill, and noticed my brakes weren't working at all. Speed was picking up, e-brake didn't work, and the car at the stop sign was actually stopping, and JUST had given me enough room to turn,I take a right, and  I almost T-bone a minivan, and drive onto the street, another downward hill, I try steering to the right to maybe try and stop since I slowed down a lot thanks to that turn..nope. So I swerve back onto the street, and think damn, I gotta stop this thing, I think to crash into something, but I noticed I could turn right onto an uphill street, and came in hot with another crazy right turn, then lost the momentum safely on the right side of the street, not even a couple minutes later, I see a bunch of kids, and cars on that street.   


Called insurance, towed the car back to my place, called my dad, and texted some fam that know about the car (it was previously my uncles) and just had kind of a laugh about it, but feeling extremely lucky, and grateful, and protected. I got on my knees and prayed some gratitude to God (?) for looking out for me like he always had. My dad who's been around for awhile considers it crazy lucky too, and weird timing because he's been feeling a pull to biblical stories lately. 

Did God save my life? in all the sense, like theres a couple things that could've happened.   
1. I crash into a car - (airbags got recalled in that car) so I would've probably gotten seriously injured, face, hands, legs, etc.  
2. I hit someone and crash into a car - jail, blood on my hands cus of pure negligence. 

3. I hit someonee and their kid - all of the above but worse x100.

2302,"*Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes*

*For YHWH will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken. (Prov 3:25-26)*

Everyone feels fear. First comes the feeling of fear, then comes a reaction of being afraid. However, we have the option to react differently. We do not need to submit to fear. When we submit to God's will and strive for full obedience to Him, He will give us the confidence to overcome fear and be unafraid. 

*This book of the law will not depart out of your mouth; but you will meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it: for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.*

*Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be dismayed: for YHWH your God is with you where ever you go. (Josh 1:8-9)*

There are plently of courageous people out there. However, there is a big difference between regular courage and the good courage that YHWH spoke of to Joshua. Good courage does not come from simply saying we have faith in God. Good courage is founded in true faith. True faith is founded in obedience, becoming set apart from this wicked world, and then witnessing the supreme power of YHWH. 

*Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore. For YHWH loves judgment, and forsakes not His saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked will be cut off (Psalm 37:27-28)*

There are many instances in the Old Testament where mighty warriors are defeated, not because of the strength of their opposition, but because YHWH filled them with sudden fear that they could not overcome.

*""The Assyrians will be destroyed, but not by the swords of men. The sword of God will strike them, and they will panic and flee. The strong young Assyrians will be taken away as captives. Even the strongest will quake with terror, and princes will flee when they see your battle flags,"" says YHWH, whose fire burns in Zion, whose flame blazes from Jerusalem. (Isa 31:8-9)*

So again, everyone feels fear. Those who are able to overcome it are those who truly seek obedience to the Most High God YHWH with their whole hearts."

One such retort showed a picture of starving kids in Africa, who were so thin that their ribcages were practically visible. Then the post said, in paraphrase, something along the lines of: ""Your God doesn't care about these starving kids but I'm glad He has time to condemn 2 men consenting to oral sex.""

Not to play devil's advocate or anything (I am a Christian), **but does God care about homosexuality more than starving kids? And if not, then why are there starving kids?**

2310,"Hello guys, I wanted to ask you in hope of getting some confusion cleared in my mind, why is sin subjective? If we all have the Holy Spirit within us then why some people think something is not a sin while others do?

For example, I personally cannot believe that masturbation is a sin, because of the health benefits it provides to both stress relief and semen health (in males im not sure about females) it just seems to go against logic for it to be a sin, and yes maybe porn may be a sin but it depends on what kind of porn, if it’s something that made someone suffer in any way then I think it’s definitely bad but if it’s something harmless I can’t find in me the reason why it’s a sin. But for some people it is a sin and I’ve read various reasons why but they still can’t convince me

At the same time there are people who believe that killing someone for self defense is acceptable, or that killing animals to eat them is ok etc, and then there is me, who literally spent the last 4 night trying to shoo away a mosquitoe out of my room because I don’t want to kill her cus then I’d feel bad… unsuccessfully I might add. What I mean to say is that morals are different, and although we may all agree on some stuff (example: eating toddlers is bad) some other stuff have some degrees of “is it though?” I hope I managed to explain myself well since English is not my language.

Another thing I can’t even fathom is the concept of infernalism, I really wouldn’t wish eternal suffering on my worst toddler-eating enemy and yet some Christians think someone who masturbates while watching porn should go there it just baffles me that there is all this difference although we are all loved we then choose to hate.

2312,"*(from oca.org)*

Saint [Evdemoz](https://images.oca.org/icons/lg/october/1004evdemoz-catholicos0020.jpg) led the Georgian Orthodox Church in the mid-17th century during the reign of King Rostom-Khan (1632-1658), a Georgian who had converted to Islam.

Having murdered King Luarsab II of Kartli and chased out King Teimuraz I of Kakheti, the Persian shah Abbas I had declared Rostom-Khan ruler of a unified Kartli-Kakheti kingdom.

Rostom tried to be accommodating in his policies and protect the beliefs and traditions of both the Persian shah and the Georgian people: he set a standard salary for the Georgian clergy and even built churches, but society deteriorated rapidly nevertheless. Human vices became commonplace, and sins like those of Sodom and Gomorrah were multiplied. The nation was so overtaken by sin that even the clergy ceased to conduct themselves in a manner befitting their God-given role.

But the chief shepherd of the Georgian nation would not yield to the moral decline of his flock, and he confronted this crisis with conviction and fearlessness. Several times he led his most valiant military leaders in revolt against Persia. Following the example of Catholicos Evdemoz, several Georgian princes rebelled against the pro-Persian policies of Rostom-Khan and cast out the Islamic influence from their territories.

Catholicos Evdemoz resisted the Islamic custom of raising the king’s heirs in the shah’s court from a young age. He was never too intimidated by the king to expose his wrongdoing and tell him at every convenient opportunity: “You are the natural father of the Muslims, but the stepfather of the Christians!”

Evdemoz was the spiritual father of Rostom-Khan’s wife, the faithful Queen Mariam, the daughter of Manuchar Dadiani, Prince of Samegrelo.

As a result of the holy labors of Catholicos Evdemoz and Queen Mariam, the Christian soul of the Georgian people was not entirely extinguished. The Georgians built churches, wrote spiritual literature, and gradually regained their national consciousness. Catholicos Evdemoz preached throughout the country and developed and implemented a plan to bring King Teimuraz, who had been driven out by Shah Abbas, back to the throne.

Naturally Rostom-Khan felt threatened by the strong influence Catholicos Evdemoz had on the people. In 1642 he arrested the chief shepherd of the Georgian people and tried to win him over, but neither his feigned tenderness nor his threats could break the firm will of the man who loved Christ and his motherland above all else. After his arrest, Saint Evdemoz criticized the king even more harshly and called on the people to rise up against him. Finally Rostom-Khan ordered that Catholicos Evdemoz be strangled to death in his prison cell, and as a further insult, his body was cast off Nariqala Fortress (in Tbilisi) in the direction of the Turkish baths.

That night, a group of Christians stole the body of the holy hieromartyr Catholicos-Patriarch Evdemoz and buried it in the northwest corner of Anchiskhati Church in Tbilisi.

2313,"Hi, everyone. I am a 16 year old boy from Hungary and I am a member of the Reformed Church. I started strengthening my relationship with God about a year ago. Since then I became obsessed with religion and started studying how other Churches praise the Lord. As I learned about the Churches of the world, I realized that Roman Catholicism is closer to my beliefs and quickly became an enthusiast. I started reading the Catholic scripture and books written by Catholic priests. I am thinking of converting. The problem I have is that the circumstances I live in inhibit me from doing so. The town I live in is 90% Protestant and the Catholic church is not very active here. The local protestant pastor is also a very good friend of my family and I don't want to make her sad by leaving the church because she has been so generous to me. I am also a member of Royal Rangers (an international scout movement organized by Protestants) so that makes it even harder. And I don't really know what to do or what to think

I would be thankful if you guys could give me some advice about what should I do. I am a fickle person, I have a lot of phases that will die out eventually. So maybe I am just going through another phase again but I feel like it's a sign and maybe God wants me to join the Catholic church."
2314,"Hey guys! So I’ve had a strained relationship with my mother my whole life and always wanted to have a good mother daughter relationship. In highschool my mom got into witch stuff and truly believes she’s a witch chosen from God and a light worker and sees visions and all of this mumbo jumbo. I’ve gotten to the point I pretty much just zone out and ignore what she’s saying unless it’s “how are you doing daughter?” Or “I love you” just because I want to keep a relationship with my mother. I’ve been confrontational with her before but it gets me no where, it’s like talking to a brick wall when I’m trying to reason with her. I know God says to honor your mother and your father but he also says to stay away from things like witchcraft. I’m trying to get closer to God everyday, I want to be what he wants me to be like. I’m just not sure about this situation and how he would want me to look at it. Any advise or perspectives would be super appreciated. Thanks for reading."
2315,"Next year I’ll be starting my 4 year medical degree for naturopathic medicine to become an ND. Some ND’s are very strictly medicine and health while SOME Naturopathic medicine practitioners also incorporate spirituality into their work based on the importance of mind, body and spiritual health for the overall well being of their patients. ND’s that do incorporate spirituality tend to practice more new age spiritualism like the universe, energies, manifestation, etc. I’m fairly new to Christianity and I understand the issue with this thinking is that it’s under the idea that we are in control and can save ourselves instead of giving the credit where it’s due, which is obviously to God. Before being Christian, I was still believed jn God and prayed to God and thanked him for strength and blessings, but was also into the other stuff because in my mind, God created everything, including the use of these other “tools” so there is a realm where they can all coexist. I’m still not 100% sure where I sit with this, but all the spirituality aside, just looking at the health and medicine of naturopathy, is it anti-Christian? One of the core beliefs is that the body has the ability to heal itself, which is why some claim it’s anti-Christian. But from my perspective, God designed us to be able to do these things. These are his blessings. Help your newly Christian, very crunchy, potentially future ND friend out :)"
2316,"I love to research and go into things like this on my own time just for fun but I’m coming to the end of the list I made myself and would love some external input, what are some of the most debated or just interesting controversial/dense Christian topics?

2317,"I have OCD and something that brings me anxiety happened. So, a co worker left and my ocd kept saying “do you wish him good well or no?” I fell in the trap and said something (I think I said no or idk), but regardless of my answers, I was mad at him because he called Hitler a good leader. I just couldn’t even look at him. That’s horrible. So now I’m trapped in OCD wanting me to say something (wishing him good or bad) and regardless of what I say. I will have anxiety. 

Now, I have been praying and or asking for forgiveness. I was doing something for my date and before that I prayed and or asking for forgiveness saying something like “I don’t support him because of what he said” then I corrected my prayers and then I went to do what I was going for my date. OCD tells me that my dates will be horrible because of what I said and now I’m fearing everything. I mean what if I did accept that maybe my dates and the relationships would go bad because of it? I don’t remember. I have no other choice but to exposure?"
2319,"I have been interested in the religious and the metaphysical aspects of the world since before I could remember, and today I finally decided to pick up the Bible and read it so I can get a better understanding of His word. Starting off at Genesis 1:1, I had a couple of questions that were easily remedied by a quick search on the internet. However, I am reading the story of the murder of Abel in Genesis 4, and I am just a little confused, and also intrigued. I am well aware that Cain didn't give his offerings in faith as Abel did, and I am aware of why Caine murdered Abel. I am just confused on God's thought process. As He is omniscient, which I have been led to believe as I was raised Baptist Christian, could He have purposely provoked Abel's murder? I think this could make sense in a way, as it was a teaching moment for Cain and the reader about not only the introduction to the sin of murder, but it also paves way for us to see God's merciful nature in Genesis 4:15, ""Whoever kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over (Christian Standard)."" I am no critic, I just want to know if my hypothesis is correct. Thank you."

2322,"Satan's goal is to discourage us. When Satan attacks our thoughts with discouragement, as real as the discouragement feels, we must recognize it as a lie. There is amazing power in doing this, and choosing to remain in faith and high hopes of the Most High God YHWH. There is amazing power in choosing to discard our worldly desires, and focusing our entire desire on a pursuit of perfect obedience to YHWH.

*Blessed is the man that trusts in the YHWH, and whose hope the YHWH is. For he will be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the river, and will not see when heat comes, but her leaf will be green; and will not be anxiousl in the year of drought, neither will cease from yielding fruit. The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? I YHWH search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.(Jer 17:7-10)*

*Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor what is evil; cleave to what is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another; Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality. Bless them who persecute you: bless, and curse not. (Romans 12:9-14)*

*For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says YHWH, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. Then you will call upon Me, and you will go and pray to Me, and I will hearken to you. And you will seek , and find Me, when you will search for Me with all your heart. (Jer 29:11-13)*

*By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation works patience; And patience, experience; and experience, hope: And hope makes not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit that is given to us. (Romans 5:2-5)*

*My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:*

2326,"I've heard Father Chad Ripperger talk about how if you watch the Harry Potter movies or read the books you'll become possessed by a demon! I love Harry Potter. I've been to Harry Potter World in Florida and I've seen all the movies. Never been possessed. However, I wouldn't want my niece to watch the movies, even though I want to show them to her.

Can anybody point me to a priest who says that Harry Potter is okay?"
2327," Now the disasters are everywhere and getting worse and worse. Many true Christians are all earnestly looking for the Lord to return. The Lord Jesus once promised: “… I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also.” (John 14:2-3). According to the Lord’s promise, most brothers and sisters are awaiting the Lord to come back to take us to the kingdom of heaven so that we can enjoy the eternal blessings in the beautiful kingdom.   


We all firmly believe that our dream of the heavenly kingdom can be realized when the Lord comes to lift us to the sky.  However, Matthew 6:9-10 “After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come, Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.” So is the place the Lord has prepared for us in heaven or on earth? Where exactly is the kingdom of heaven? "
2328,"In times of depression, Scripture offers comfort by reminding us of God's love, faithfulness, and His promises. The Bible assures us that we are not alone in our struggles and that God is with us every step of the way. For example, in Psalm 34:17-18, it says, ""The righteous cry out, and the Lord hears them; he delivers them from all their troubles. The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."" This verse reminds us that God is attentive to our cries and He will deliver us from our troubles. Additionally, Scripture reminds us to cast our anxieties on Him because He cares for us (1 Peter 5:7). So, when we find ourselves feeling overwhelmed or depressed, turning to the Word of God can bring comfort, hope, and remind us of His unfailing love and care for us."
2329,"I was reading a comment from someone who said that the concept of hell and heaven is like a carrot and stick for Christians, the carrot being heaven, leading them to keep followers in line with only the illusion of a reward. Obviously I disagree but it got me thinking. 

Im curious, if you believe in hell, does the concept of hell give you fear regarding how you conduct your life? Does it deepen your connection to your religion? Does it make you a better person/follower of Christ?

For me I have never really felt like hell was a place for me so I have never done good things because I specifically feared it. My connection with god is rooted in the motivation to deepen my understanding of the world, be a better person and have a stable foundation for my life. I try to do my best not because I’m scared of eternal torture or I want to live forever, but in the sense I want to make my creator proud. Is this uncommon?"

2334,"(Spoilers for the movie Silence)

So be warned, heavy questions incoming. I'm asking this because the Scorsese movie 'Silence' is on my mind. If you haven't seen it I think it's a really wonderful, albeit difficult film to watch. And that film explores the concept of people going through very intense suffering all for their faith in Christ.

One thing I want to hone in on is the burden that the main priest character played by Andrew Garfield goes through. He's trying to spred Christianity in medieval Japan, and he's captured, and the Japanese authorities use some ghastly phsyical and psychological torture to get them to renounce Christ by literally stepping on an image of Jesus.

And under  this immense torture, some people break. Others don't, and are subject to horrific executions. And the authorities are very insidious: In their attempt to get this priest to renounce God, they torture not him, but those of his flock.

Eventually it gets to the point that all of Garfield's Japanese flock have rejected God, but the authorities *still* torture them. Telling Garfield that their suffering will only end if *Garfield* steps on the image of Christ. Which he eventually does, And I've seen Father Barron come down pretty harsh on this, calling Garfield's character a traitor.

My question is: Why not just say you're not a Christian under such circumstances? Why not outwardly reject Christ, even if you are lying to save yourself and others from  immense harm?

Because if God truly did love Garfield like a parent loves their child, God and Jesus would want Garfield to save himself and his flock from this agony, right? The only reason why Garfield wouldn't do this, is to maintain and demonstrate glory to God.

But if I, as a parent, care more about my children being subservient, loyal, and worshipful of me *more* than I care about their own well-being and happiness, then I'm not a very good parent am I? We'd call any human who actually treated their children this way as a vain psychopath right?

Like, say my children were being tortured, and the only way for them to be spared was for them to denounce me. That they would have to confess all kinds of lies about how I was a bad person, confess about crimes and murders I didn't commit which would have me sent to prison or killed. I would *want* my kids to knowingly tell those lies, because I care about them more than I do myself.

For people like Garfield's character and his flock to go through these kinds of trials, and fail to uphold God's glory, and then presumably go to hell for that, just seems... so vicious, and cruel, and mean and downright petty on God's part.

So was Garfield right to step on the image of Christ? And if he was not, how does that make God anything but a vain psychopath?"
2335,"Sometimes (Not  all the time....)

2336,"About a month and a half ago, I was outside hanging out on some grass, I was spaced out and tired, and I was thinking about how the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus. I was thinking about how incredible it is and I imagined in my mind how the Holy Spirit comes upon believers and I accidentally muttered out loud to myself “I have the Holy Spirit, which is crazy” and I immediately felt intense conviction and sadness as I remembered what Jesus said about blaspheming the Holy Ghost, and I stopped what I was doing and went inside and essentially grieved at what I just said. I was very afraid, and I still am to be honest. I didn’t mean “crazy” as in mentally ill, I often use the word “crazy” in a neutral or even positive way, like for example when someone tells me something interesting or unexpected that happened to them, I’ll be like “that’s crazy”. I was mainly thinking about how profound it is that I have the Holy Spirit when I said the “which is crazy” part. I didn’t mean to blaspheme or insult the Holy Ghost, but I’m very worried because Jesus said in Matthew 12:32 that “whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.” I don’t think what I said was against the Holy Spirit and I certainly didn’t mean for it to be, but I feel that I possibly used irreverent language that could possibly be interpreted as blasphemy. But I truly didn’t mean it as an insult. I would never insult the Holy Spirit. I am very frightened and I just want to be forgiven of all my sins and have salvation so that I can be in Heaven with God after I die. Nothing scares me more than the thought of going to hell. This has been very perplexing for me because I do believe once saved always saved, but I’m just very scared that I committed an unforgivable sin. I don’t want to think I did but it’s been tormenting me a lot lately. Jesus said we are justified by our words but that we’re also condemned by our words. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much"
2337,"when I think about God, everything makes clear sense to me; well except one thing.

I understand that people can do good or bad things, and that is just part of our agency, but one thing that I always wonder about is why bad things happen to good people.

I know this is like a really big point against Christianity, but I'm genuinely wondering what you guys think about it.

There's this movie called, ""The Girl in the basement"" or something like that where a father traps his daughter in the basement for 26 years to ""teach her a lesson"" about misbehaving. The father did some bad stuff to her and she ended up having like 6 children or something crazy like that, and 2 of them lived down with her, and the others were set free at birth because it would get too crowded down there.

I think about this movie a lot because it's a true story that actually happened to someone, and I can't even imagine how bad it was for her and her children.

It's not like she was tricked or made a bad decision that led to her being trapped down there, because her father, one of the people she trusted the most, did this to her. You can't blame someone for trusting their own parental figure.

When I think about this, I ask God, why did this happen to her? I try to think about every possible answer, but it's the one thing that just never adds up.

What do you guys think about this?"
2338,"Before you condemn me as a lunatic with a messiah complex, understand that one of the people you accuse of this has to be the real deal at some point.

2339,"My church isn’t a traditional Sunday morning church. We’re made up of a bunch of small groups, and meet in houses. We have a home church meeting (20-30 people), a central teaching (similar to a Sunday morning church service, but with no music), cell group (men and women’s individual bible study) and fellowship with another person in the home church group once a week is heavily encouraged. I don’t go to the central teaching because I have too much other responsibilities, and I feel that having 3 meetings a week is more than enough fellowship. If I miss a few meetings then I’m called out, and people ask what’s going on. I’m a college student, and it’s my last semester. Sometimes I have to miss a meeting to do school work, or take care of other needs in my life.

2342,"Hello everyone! I’m a philosophy student at the University at Albany and I’m doing research about the viewpoints of different religions and practices. I decided that I would love to reach out to people with different perspectives! In particular, about Aristotelean virtues. I believe that hearing from people themselves is much more valuable than just looking it up online. 

Anyway, if you’d like, would you want to answer some questions about your practices’ views on virtues? You can answer as many or as few as you’d like. I’m not weighing the results against each other, just seeing the similarities and differences with Aristotle! I am also aware that each religion and practice has so much diversity, so if you’d like you could just tell me about your own if applicable!

Aristotle’s virtues are wisdom, prudence, justice, fortitude, courage, liberality, magnificence, magnanimity, and temperance. Aristotle says that these virtues come from within and are honed throughout our lifetime. 

So, these are the questions I've come up with:

1. Out of the virtues I mentioned above, which three are the most important, or the most emphasized in your practice, and why? If there’s others that are important, please feel free to mention them!

2. In your practice, where do virtues come from? Aristotle says that they are honed within us over our lifetimes- how about yours? Do they come from a higher power, from the universe, from yourself, etc? 

3. For Aristotle, “eudaimonia” is the highest possible good a person can be, without using it as a means to an end. Eudaimonia is achieved by living virtuously, or living with moral excellence. What does your practice say about how we can achieve this peak good?

4. What does acting virtuous look like in the daily life of someone who is involved in your practice?

Thank you so much! Your feedback is very appreciated."
2343,"So obligatory backstory: I was saved in March 2023 of this year. I’ve had multiple experiences that can only be testimonies to the power of Jesus. Two nights ago, I experienced a different kind of power. It didn’t scare me, and to be honest it’s driven me closer to God since. Before I was saved, I was a adulterer who slept around a lot. The devil has used this against me in the past in attempts to drive me into sexual sin. 

As for the story…

So a few nights ago I went to sleep like usual. Whenever I face temptation, especially the push to consume porn or hookups, I pray to Jesus to take it away from me. 

So I fall asleep, and to be honest, I don’t remember any part of my dream up until the very end. All of a sudden, I was in a place of complete darkness. There was absolutely nothing around me, but blackness. Imagine walking into a closet and shutting the door, you can’t see anything but you know you are somewhere. I was completely aware of my surroundings, or lack thereof. All of a sudden, I saw a face appear in front of me. No body, just a face. It was grey, withered, with disgusting looking features. No discernible gender. It had light blue iris with black pupils, that kind of protruded from its face to give a monster like appearance. It didn’t say anything, didn’t smile, didn’t laugh. Just peered back at me as I stared at it. A blank expression on its face, like it was observing me as I observed it. Almost like I was watching it though the mirror. 

At first, I was terrified. Genuinely scared of what I was seeing. As a Christian, I knew exactly what it could only be. A demon. So In my dream, I began to pray. 

Immediately after praying in the dream, I woke up with my heart racing, shot out of bed, and continued to pray. I have never experienced something like that before. And before you say, “it was just a dream”, consider the fact that demons WILL intrude on your life and tempt you into sin. Fearing a demon is a sin, as God is the only one to be feared. 

A few days later, I cannot shake that face out of my mind. It was so surreal, so scary, every time I feel tempted to sin, I imagine spending an eternity looking at that.. thing… and run right back to God."
2344,"Had it not been for the European Christians who colonized Africa and South America, those lands would have remained pagan to this day, and as a result, their inhabitants would have been doomed to hell forever.

2347," Im incredibly torn on whether or not I should be catholic. Currently im protestant, I think baptist or something like that. A few weeks ago I learned that there are many different denominations of Christianity and I really never even thought about Catholicism or orthodoxy or any of that. After some loose research on beliefs and general stuff (also attended a mass), I can say that ive gotten absolutely nowhere, one day I'll find great evidence/verses etc that point towards catholicism, then the next day the opposite will happen. I currently have a great relationship with my church and my mom says that I should stick with it (she was raised catholic and is against it), but I can't help but questions whether I should convert, there are things on both sides that I like and dislike.

2348,"I am getting married in a few months and after conversing with my SO we both decided that I should investigate my faith more. Her faith is something that is important to her and is something I want to work on to hopefully grow us even closer. 

I grew up in a Christian home going to church every Sunday and involved in Young life etc. I always assumed I was a Christian because I believed in ""something"" out there and assumed it was God. Fast forward a few years and I don't know where I am at. I am a left brain thinker and currently can't see why anyone has deep faith in something that they have little/no empirical evidence to support. I have many questions and am looking for someone to answer them. I don't currently belong to a church but am moving soon and intend on finding one. I genuinely want to believe something however I am seriously struggling with where to begin. "
2350,"People always say god is good and yet in the Old Testament he orders the killing of many. 

How so? Is it good to cause pain, war, and bloodshed simply because you can? Even if it is for the greater good, there will still be suffering and many lives taken – the lives of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters. Why cause suffering in the first place? Is there no other way? How can someone be considered all-loving, even called a father, if he is the cause of his child's pain? Or perhaps we're not actually his children, perhaps we're all just his creatures.

However, I had many friends who were Baptist and Methodist along the years who would curse and such and when I’d talk to them about god they would say once saved always saved.  To me that’s always felt wrong, but as I’m older I’m having a hard time getting right with myself.  I watch porn, masturbate, and curse.  I know I shouldn’t do these things, however I’ve always struggled with if I sin do I need to repent immediately?  Willl one sin keep me from heaven?  I always had an uncle who would say in his prayer for food asking him to forgive him of my sins and wonder if he ended up in heaven from sinning every day from doing tobacco or drinking alcohol.   There truly just is so much confusion in the world today of what it takes to get to heaven.  Then you have some who say they will just repent on their death bed."

2363,"So I have been looking for a good church in my local area and found one a few weeks ago. I go there with my friends and I really liked the pastor and his style of teaching. it was also full of people my age so it was easier to connect and whatnot.

However, last Saturday night something happened that completely broke my heart.  


So the day began like every other day. We all sat down and the pastor began preaching.  it was all normal, I was engaged and listening. then I looked down on my hands and noticed that I was sweating.  
I thought ""this is weird' and tried to wipe my arm but the sweat was still there, I was confused but didn't think too much of it.   


then after the sermon and singing, we all stood up to pray, and as we were praying the pastor said to look down at our hand. I did, and low and behold it was full of glitter. in fact almost everyone around me and in the entire church had a lot of glitter on their body.   


the pastor claimed this was the work of God and a sign from God and that it's a ""heavenly gold"". I was literally frozen in time. 

so now I am wondering, why would someone do this? what's the purpose. is this really God? I thought the pastor came off as genuine and he pulls something like this?  


I don't plan on going again, I have made friends with 2, 3 people there and I have their number maybe I'll stay in touch if they want to. But it's just a sad. "

It’s just so hard for me to believe in the existence of the soul.  Like, I’ve heard that strong evidence against the existence of the soul is brain damage;  when your brain is damaged enough,  you’re a completely different person.  Doesn’t that prove that we’re just our brains?  Like,  isn’t Christianity just blind belief? (I really don’t want it to be. :( )  I just need some evidence for anything really (God, Jesus, souls, etc.) to sink my nails into.  It’s hard for me to trust near death experiences because people say that it’s just a hallucination that the dying brain is going through.  Please help!"

2368,"Hi all, I am 24 and I have never had any religion my entire life. I found it hard to believe in something so much bigger than myself. But last night, something guided me into looking at Christianity, I read for hours about the bible and the ideals around Christianity. It felt important and I felt like I wanted to begin my new life with God. I prayed for the first time in my entire life last night, and I said to God if this is the path I should take and if this is all 'real', please send me some kind of sign.

This morning when I woke up, I found out the news that a family member who had been seriously ill, struggling and uncomfortable for months, had passed away peacefully. Although sad news, I believe God took him and helped to end his suffering, his sign to **me**.

This is all so new to me and I don't really know where to start, but I believe this is the path I am supposed to take in my life. Thank you for reading, god bless. "
2369,"I stumbled in my faith not long ago. Now that I am working hard to get back where I need to be, I’ve noticed that as I grow closer with God, temptation seems to increase or become stronger.

I don't what should I do.




I turned christian but I never truly accepted or believed in God, I just started believing because people told me too, I found out that every thought in my mind rejects the idea of God, I just please God and pray because not only I'm afraid of him actually existing and punishing me, I also used God as a kind of shield I would use in any situation to make sure I'm ok.

I wanted God to please me with banal things that's why I prayed for him, I didn't even truly love or believe in him I'm just afraid. 

My whole nature and ideology is based on liberty and freedom and I absolutely hated christianity telling me what should or not do with every cell of my body..


I AM IMPURE, we all are, I'm selfish because it's my nature, what should I do? I'm lost, I fear God punishing me, I honestly don't enjoy being a Christian anymore, I love myself, I look myself a lot in the mirror, I would want to start focusing on myself and improving my life but I view this as impure and selfish.



What should I do? If God is truly like what the bible despicts I honestly don't think Christianity is for me because I can't accept the idea of God being disappointed in everything I do, every day because I sin daily, every thought that runs through my mind is selfish and sinful.



Please help me."

2377,"I (F22) wanted to start by saying that I used to consider myself an atheist, but recently, I've become more open to the idea of a 'God.' For the past few months, I've been immersing myself in Christianity content online, trying to learn more about it and debating whether or not it resonates with me. Honestly, I've never invested this much thought and effort into questioning my beliefs before. It's been a constant internal battle, especially since I've always kept myself closed off from any religion, just living my life as it comes. So, I've been utterly confused about what to believe.

During these past months I’ve often thought to myself, 'Maybe I just need a sign.' And recently, while I was with my boyfriend, and was relaxing in bed, looking at what he was browsing on the laptop. He was reading something on a website (I can't recall exactly what it was), but I know it had nothing to do with Christianity, God, or religion. Then, as he scrolled towards the end of the website, I saw in big bold letters on the screen: 'TRUST IN GOD.' My heart started racing, and I felt a mix of excitement and fear. Was this just a coincidence, or was it a sign?"""
2378,"At the beginning of this year I decided to reread the Bible, got a nice study Bible and downloaded a random reading plan. This particular one splits the days by topic. If you have any thoughts or insights I'm happy to listen and learn. I can be snarky at times but I hope to never be disrespectful. I'm going to do it again in 2024 so if you want to hop on the bus then I'll get back to where you started from. So on this reading plan it's Psalms Wednesday.

I'll be completely honest, I've never seen the point of Psalms. We did one every Sunday in church and that was enough for me. I love the History chapters, the Gospels and wrestling with the Law but I'm still not enjoying the Psalms.

So Psalm 117, wow that's very short. At only two verses long I think it's the shortest chapter in the Bible. Interestingly some words in verse 1 jump out, *""O praise the LORD,* ***all ye nations:*** *praise him, all ye people""* Up to now God has been an exclusive God, only concerned with the Israelites, now the psalms want all nations to praise Him. Why the change of focus? Why now?

Psalm 118 seems to pick up where 117 ends, 118:1 is an echo of 117:2. But the focus has changed back to being one of exclusivity. The nations that 117 wanted to praise God are now there to be destroyed by God. The phrase *""in the name of the Lord I will destroy them""* is repeated three times. It all feels rather distasteful. That distaste in me grows with verses 19 and 20 when after destroying the enemies the psalmist enters the gates of righteousness. By tradition that's King David himself which explains 22, *""The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.""* because he had been passed over in favour of Saul and only later became King.

That's all I can really gather, tomorrow it's Poetry Thursday with Proverbs 28."
2379,"Florida recently put to death a rapist and murderer. Whenever this happens there is always a little outburst on Twitter of Anti-Death penalty activists being upset. A number of these are progressive Catholics. Since there are a good number of very knowledgeable Catholics in this sub I thought this might be worth a discussion. 

The death penalty is currently against Catholic social teaching. It has not always been this way, with the famed Saint Thomas Aquinas making an argument for the Death Penalty in his work Summa Contra Gentiles. Pope Pius X in 1908 also supported the Death Penalty. In 1952 Pope Pius XII didn’t regard the execution of criminals as denying someone their “right to life.” This teaching appeared to change around 1997 under Saint John Paul II with some of his works advocating that the death penalty should be “very rare or non-existent as bloodless means to control criminals has progressed. The anti-death penalty stance solidified under Pope Benedict XVI saying that governments should make every effort to “ the need to make every effort to eliminate the death penalty and to reform the penal system in a way that ensures respect for the prisoners' human dignity.” In 2018 the Catechism formally changed to read ""in the light of the Gospel"" that ""the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person"".

So there are a great many progressive Catholic activists who would like to do away with the death penalty under this new rubric. I thought it might be interesting to discuss what some Catholics here think.

Personally I find it more than a little distasteful and immoral that I see more Catholics advocating for murderers and rapists than actually serving and ministering to victims. I find it inconsistent with God’s comfort for the suffering."

**in the beginning was the spirit**

the spirit was with God and the spirit

was God

and the spirit became flesh and dwelt

among men

God is not a book God is not a Bible

there was no Bible in the beginning

the Bible was compiled after the fact

in the beginning was the spirit and when

the church the Holy Ghost Church The

Church of Jesus Christ the real Church

really is the kingdom of God it wasn't a

church it's really the kingdom Jesus had

told his disciples he said and Terry

until you be endured with power from on

high so they had to wait until the

unfailing of the Holy Spirit fell upon

him and then they ministered the spirit

Peter stood up amongst them and he said

this is that that was prophesied at the

prophets Joel and Jeremiah they

prophesied the gift of God the seed of

God

the Holy Spirit which regenerates us

which reconciles us back to our father

through Jesus Christ and so

the apostles went forth and they laid

hands on them and they received the Holy

Spirit they ministered the gospel

the true gospel and so when you Bible

process you quote that scripture If any

man preach any other gospel then ye have

received then let him be accursed well

you don't know what you're saying

because you're preaching another gospel

you're preaching dead letter you're

preaching constantinian gospel and and

Queen James gospel which is Gospel

another gospel those are gospels of the

devil the real gospel is simple repent

from living after the flesh ask Jesus to

fill you with the Holy Spirit and then

live after the spirit as the Spirit

guides you it isn't trying to keep the

Ten Commandments that was under the old

Covenant which no one could keep when

Jesus came he came to fulfill the law

and he was preaching the law he was

teaching some about the New Covenant

that was to come but it didn't come

until after he died on the cross and

then when the Holy Spirit was poured out

on the day of Pentecost so trying to

keep the law from the book

is being under the curse of the law

because you're in the flesh and you

can't be regenerated that way and you

don't receive the Holy Spirit by

claiming scriptures

and saying come tie my tie or shubala

that's baloney you get the Holy Spirit

from the living Jesus Christ and when he

fills you with the Holy Spirit you'll

know it it's a wonderful Awakening in

you you'll think different after that

you'll have a new nature a nature of God

an Angelic nature you won't be attracted

to the Earth you'll be attracted to God

and to the things of Heaven and so when

you when you're coming on here and

you're saying

if anyone preached any other gospel let

them be a curse you're the one preaching

the other gospel you're the one that are

deceived you are preaching and

ministering a damnable doctrine that

will take you and everyone that believes

you to help but they said that there

wouldn't be many saved many are called

few were chosen well today few are

called and even fewer are chosen because

you choose to believe the lie the strong

delusion that if we're possible even the

very elect would be deceived because

Satan took the actual writings of some

of God's people and he compiled it into

a lie and authorized it claiming it to

have authority from God is the word of

God over you and then he used it when he

created the constantinian mother of

harlot's church and combined it with

paganism

which was the beginning of Catholicism

and then she gave birth to all these

Protestant prostitute churches

they used their Bible and their religion

and other 40 some thousand different

denominations to label God's true Holy

Spirit people as Devils and Heretics and

demons and to kill them what kind of a

holy spirit failed Christian kills other

Christians because they don't come under

their belief in their religious Doctrine

from the Bible only demonic people do

that it's pretty obvious the difference

between a holy spirit failed person and

a Bible worshiper so you're the ones

preaching another gospel

you're not preaching the First Gospel

the true gospel you're deceived you were

born into this delusion and it's been

going on for so many centuries that you

think it's the original gospel but it's

not

and Jesus had mercy on this generation

to tell you that the Bible is an idol it

was compiled into an Isle and to tell

you that it's become the mark of the

beast because the Beast and the Beast

system uses it to deceive you and

control you it's the devil controlling

you in the flesh Through the Bible he

makes you a doormat to his people making

you keep the principles in the Bible

that don't even apply to you he's making

you a servant you have to love Devils

you have to if they ask you anything you

have to give it to them well that's a

lie from hell we stay away from Sinners

except a witness to him or do what we

have to do in the world to live but we

don't participate with them we don't

become doormats to them we're led by the

living Jesus Christ we're not controlled

by the dead Letter Bible by you evil

Sinners quote scriptures to try to get

your own will done and by the devil

trying to control us and keep us out of

the Holy Spirit when you do get in the

spirit he tries to scare you out of the

spirit and confuse you so you're the

ones preaching another gospel and those

of you that have the Holy Spirit the

real Holy Spirit you know this is true

you understand the mystery of God that

is Christ in you

the hope of glory it's not words from a

book in you and these people they

imagine they worship and serve the

Living God and the living Jesus Christ

but it's just an image they have built

in their mind from the Bible they've

never met Jesus they've never heard his

voice they don't know him they know

about him and they really cut a fit when

they hear this truth and they like to

point fingers and they really have some

foul language some of them and they like

to accuse us and damn us because they're

the ones can give and they're the ones

wrong and it cuts them to their soul so

Holy Ghost children stay the course stay

with the truth you know it's the truth

you're on your way to heaven and they're

on their way to hell so stay with the

living gospel the original gospel and

there were no Bibles back in those days

there were some Old Testament books and

manuscripts and stuff they weren't

really in book form they were Scrolls

and only a very few had them the

synagogues have some of them and the

temple has some but that was the old

Covenant law the letters that are

included now in the New Testament they

weren't even compiled yet they weren't

even written yet and then Constantine

had them all gathered together and they

chose which ones went into the Bible and

which ones weren't the word of God and

which ones were the word of God evil men

sun god Pagan worshipers so stay with

the living Jesus Christ and the truth

our soul will live Eternal with him and

the book will burn with the Earth and

all those that don't go and be filled

with the Holy Spirit and don't walk in

the truth in the spirit with Jesus

Christ

it's a hard truth but it's the plain

**sinful truth**"
2385," This is a question of mine, and I would like to hear how you all perceive it. Perhaps more people expressing their viewpoints can shed more light on this topic.

First, let's share a passage of scripture，Acts 11:26 from the New Testament reads as follows: 

>**""Barnabas went to look for Saul, and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year, Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch.""**

Early believers were called Christians not because of their religious beliefs but because they had the presence of the Lord Jesus in their lives, radiating God's light through their actions. However, in this age, we often place more emphasis on religious appearances while neglecting a genuine relationship with God.

Even though the church is a place of worship, we might also observe some behaviors that are not pleasing to God, such as disharmony, lack of inclusiveness, or disagreements within small groups; lack of transparency in financial management; power struggles or decision-making difficulties, and even disagreements over worship music styles.

Of course, what I mentioned may not be universally applicable, but at least I and those around me have encountered such situations. This raises some questions for me: Why do such things happen even in places of worship? What steps should we take to seek the guidance and revelation of the Holy Spirit? Additionally, concerning the question posed in the title, what should a true Christian be like?

I hope these questions can spark deep discussions and contemplation."

2390,I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately.
2391,"Hi all, so obviously Jesus spoke against swearing. I’ve been trying to stop all together but the other day in prayer (things were pretty emotional at the time)  I was praying over something that was deeply upsetting me and in the middle of asking the Father for some clarity I swore. I wasn’t swearing directly at the Lord but it slipped out during my confessing of life’s events. Still, I felt horrible to even say a word like that in the middle of direct conversation to the Father. Clearly He knows when we say it anytime but to do it in the middle of a prayer? I don’t know I instantly felt extremely guilty and fearful of what that meant. Any insight or advice?"

We must meditate on this verse every day and do our best to practice these things. To truly demonstrate this behavior is to live in constant peace.  

Practicing real love is not easy in this world that largely demonstrates the opposite. The world is in a rush and quick to become angry. The world is constantly comparing itself to others and seeking to get ahead.

We need to stay in the present moment, and choose to be patient and kind in every situation. We need to desire to help others. We need to be grateful and content with what we have. It's good to work for more, but we must not allow achievement to puff us up. We must remember that we can do nothing without the grace of the Most High God Yahweh."
2398,I have this feeling in my stomach and I can’t tell if it is good or bad and I often get the feeling of either being as if I’m being pulled up or down
2399,"Doubting Faith

I am a Christian Orthodox, and I recently started getting doubts of God's miracles, his power and His answer of our prayers.
I know he is there, he exists, and I want to believe to Him, I want to believe that with Him, all things are possible, but I just can't. I have been an Orthodox all my life, and I'd rather die than admit than God doesn't exist, even for a joke. I also doubt that he raised Jesus from the dead, just because everything He does is just so amazing, it has become hard for me to believe, even though I want to, with all my will and heart.
I fear nothing, because I know God has got me protected. I want to say that I still have no doubts about some things of God, like he always protects me, I walk like I have Faith as A Shield.
Tell me.. What does this mean? Am I faithful to the Lord? Are the doubts just a test? I have the Holy Spirit in me, and whatever I do I first worry if it mocks or displeases The Lord somehow. Will I be saved? Please, answer me honestly, if I still have Him in my heart ane Spirit. I do not want to sin against him, but I have trouble believing some of the stuff it says in The Bible, sometimes The Bible itself."
2400,"I’m a mom, I work part-time, and worked for 5 years to get my bachelors degree. I sacrificed endless amounts of time to get it. Stayed home to do homework missing out on outings. Well my degree showed up yesterday and my fiancé did not even utter one word about it! Not a congrats, not an I’m so proud of you, nothing! 

He fully supported me getting it and pushed me to finish projects on days where I wanted to give up. I guess I’m confused by his lack of excitement. I try not to expect things from anyone but idk if it were him I’d at least say wow congrats babe or something! Am I overreacting?"
2402,"Struggling with faith

Hello I started going to church in the start of this year. I had been depressed and tired and hopeless for a few years. My brother had been a church goer for a while and has always been a good guy with a good family, I thought it was time for a change so I decided to go. The word has been amazing and rejuvenating, the people are fantastic and loving. I’m focused on getting my life back together and learning what it means to a man of god ( I’m in a bibles study right now). 

 Im a very logical person and I want to believe so bad and how my heart wants so badly for god to exist but I feel that’s what makes me hesitate and fear that god isn’t real. I want there to be some confirmation/affirmation that’s gods real. I still struggle with sexual desire and some days I succeed and some days I fail. The days I fail is usually when my faith is low. I want very deeply to love and be loved like how 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 says. 

I’ve prayed many times for god to reveal himself to let me hear his voice and to come to me in a dream, to feel his Holy Spirit anything for that “supernatural” proof of god something that I can hold onto. I’ve fasted seeking it gotten down on my hands and knees, face full of tears and heart full of repentance. I know Jesus says in john 20:29 to Thomas  “ because thou hast seen me thou believed, but blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed” I want to believe with out seeing and my life turnaround but what’s to say the Bible not just a really good self help book. even with this doubt I praise god anytime something good happens or when I need strength. The worst part is if god is real then I fear he doesn’t want me and he doesn’t want any part of me. John 6:31 says “no man can come to me, except the father which hath he sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day”

 Am I being a spoiled brat asking to have it my way? all the support helps thank you for taking the time to read and respond. Have a blessed day!"
2403,"I'm a type 1 diabetic, for over a year now my insulin which i use to control my blood sugar has not been working like it's supposed to or rather my body has not been taking it in like it's supposed to... I've tried every solution I know but nothing works and if something seems to work, it's always just temporary... I'm so tired of this life, I can't even leave my home without the fear that I'm going to pass out or something and God isn't helping me. I've prayed so many times throughout this year for him to fix this or let me know how to fix this myself but I never get an answer. I just feel like punching myself because my stupid body won't work and it's not fair. This has really tempted my faith and I'd like to ask for your prayers if that's okay."

2405,"Isaiah 13
Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses will be looted and their wives violated 13-16

I thought our creator was a good guy. I've been having my doubts about what is really ""there"" so I decided to read through verses that are not normally brought to light in my Bible study, also being told this, that and another and I found this.
Infants if you read 11-18 kj
If God is always consistent and never changes, please explain 
So please don't bring up, ""that's the OT""

Also in Samuel 
1 Samuel 15:2-3

2 This is what the Lord Almighty says: ‘I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. 3 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy[a] all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’”

2406,"Hi everyone! I was raised Christian and went on several mission trips with my youth group in high school. Since then, I’ve strayed away from Christianity.. It’s been about 10 years since I was an active Christian and started to deconstruct it. And some Christian’s around me have truthfully discouraged me from wanting to explore it again as they are exactly the ones I can’t stand. (I.e. picking and choosing what they want to follow in the Bible, stereotypically judgmental, thinks they’re above others etc) Well, in the last couple years, worship music just brings me chills and it moves me. I know that’s the sole purpose of it though. I do believe in some higher power. My question is, where do I even start with relearning everything? I’m open minded and a naturally curious person. I just feel like others around me will judge me for suddenly feeling a pull back to religion. Any words of encouragement would be nice too. Thanks!"
2407,"What is the correct Christian viewpoint if psychic/paranormal/supernatural abilities (f.e. telekinesis, remote viewing/telepathy) exist?

2412,"Once upon a time, there was a king who had a very wise minister. Whenever there were important matters in the kingdom, the king would humbly seek advice from this minister. However, no matter what the king asked, the minister always replied, “Good.” This greatly angered the king.

One day, while hunting with the minister, the king accidentally severed a part of his finger. He quickly asked the minister, """"My thumb is severed, is it good?” Without hesitation, the minister replied, “It’s good!” The king was filled with fury. He accused the minister of being cruel and unjust and had him imprisoned. Then, the king asked the minister, “Now that you are locked up in a cell, is it good?” The minister responded without hesitation, “It’s good!” The king said, “Since you think it’s good, then stay in the cell for a few more days!”

Two days later, the king decided to go hunting alone as he didn’t want to release the stubborn minister. Without the minister who was familiar with the geography accompanying him, the king quickly got lost and fell into a trap set by a local tribe of cannibals.

That night, several tribesmen bound the naked king to a cross and stacked wood beneath him. They were preparing to roast and eat him. A wizard led the ceremony, sprinkling water on the king and carefully examining his body. When the wizard came to the king’s finger, he shook his head with a sigh. After the examination, the wizard reported to the chief, “Our people only eat whole animals. This person has a severed finger, an ominous sign. We cannot eat him.” Reluctantly, the chief had to release the king.

The king had regained his life and was overwhelmed with gratitude. The first thing he did upon returning was to visit the minister in the prison. Tearfully, he said, “Now I understand why you said that my severed finger was a good thing. It saved my life. I wrongly accused you.” Later, the king, still somewhat reluctant, asked the minister, “I kept you in the cell for over ten days. Was it good?” The minister replied, """"Good, very good!” The king, puzzled, asked, “Why?” The minister explained, “Respected king, if you hadn’t imprisoned me, I would have accompanied you on the hunt. If we had fallen into the trap together and been captured by the cannibals, you could have saved your life because of your severed finger, but I would have had no chance of survival.” Upon hearing this, the king immediately understood. It was indeed a good thing!

The king lost a finger, and the minister was imprisoned. From a human perspective, these were not good things. However, in the end, these seemingly bad things turned into good things. In real life, we are often like the king with the severed finger, evaluating the goodness or badness of things based on what we see. We often consider setbacks, failures, or painful experiences as bad things, leading us to exhibit negativity, sadness, misunderstanding, and complaints. However, in reality, every event and every circumstance we encounter contains God’s infinite wisdom and marvelous arrangements, filled with His love and care. It’s just that until God reveals the outcome to us, we haven’t grasped His beautiful intentions.(Source: Internet)

After reading this short story, what are your thoughts?"
2413,"When did I choose to be created?

Why should I repent and ask forgiveness for something I didn’t choose?

God created this all in such a way that you suffer with out god. 

That if you don’t “choose” god, you “choose” hell. 
(Again goes back to when did I choose to be created) 


God knows what our “choices” are long before we are created and allows bad things to happen to us fully knowing what is going to happen to us today, tomorrow, 10 years from now."
2414,Honest question.
2416,"Prayer based on Romans 5:1-5
The peace known by a saint is more than an internal feeling.
Father, We thank You for the peace You made through the sacrifice of Your Son.
After four chapters thoroughly describing the war between God and man, Paul declares a peace that is more than an internal feeling but an external and objective condition that now exists between God and all believers. All hostility removed and peace given to those who believe in the work of Your Son – who became sin – and took the wrath that we deserved. (2 Corinthians 5:21) The curtain in the temple, which separated God from man and protected man from God, was torn in two. (Matthew 27:51, Hebrews 10:19-22) 
Father, may all know and rejoice in the peace that came through Your Son's blood shed on the cross. May we be confident and trust in Your righteous ways so we can embrace and rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that all things are from Your hand designed by You and intended for Your glory and our good. (Romans 8:28) May we rejoice daily, for You have given all believers the light of the knowledge of Your glory through Your Holy Spirit. (2 Corinthians 4:6) We praise You for Your precious gift! Amen.    
Questions for reflection and meditation:
1.	Why does Paul spend four chapters describing the problem of the fallen nature of man, before he presents the good news of the Gospel? Should this be the way you present the Gospel? Why or why not? 
2.	Is internal peace a sure sign of salvation? Why or why not?
3.	What are the sure signs of salvation?
4.	Why would a Christian rejoice in their sufferings?

Thoughts from a Martin Luther sermon:
It is possible to live in the flesh, experience peace in the world, and  have no peace with God. The opposite is ironically true for a believer who lives in the Spirit. The world will persecute a believer, and a believer will have peace with God. (2 Timothy 3:12)"

2418,"If you believe people have NDEs, then why does everyone have different experiences upon death? Christians have Christian NDEs. Muslims have Muslim NDEs. Hindus have Hindu NDEs. Some people may have weird nondual universal consciousness NDEs. Why doesn't everyone see the same thing? Seems very much like it's based on someone's cultural experience. Plus, 2 Christians can have drastically different NDEs that actually contradict what's in the Bible. How do you explain this? "
2420,"If a kid asked that question, maybe 6-10 years old, what would be your reply? In regards to original sin and being estranged from God through that. Also how it's suggested that we're all born as sinners.

I'm just aware of the places that higher thinking conversations go, expanded presentations for these questions, adults being able to consider things on a deeper level, but in a simple way how would you....well yea try and convince a kid that regardless of if they asked to be here or not, these are all facts."
2421,"I have been finding comfort in praying and reading scripture. I was not raised in the church or with faith. Because of that I have doubts as to whether or not I’m taking this journey correctly, thought to be complete honest, I don’t know if there is a correct way to do it. Please give me any advice you think is needed and I will heed it. I am very lost and I want to welcome Him into my heart and embrace all he represents and is. Thank you in advance."
2423,"This is just a snippet from the full post. Which I definitely recommend reading, like I said it helped me. 

""So in Christ (title) Jesus (name of individual) you are all children of God through faith"". Remember the faith part, it will come up again in a minute. ""If you belong to Christ (don't live in duality), then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise"" The bible also explicitly states that we ""ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST (title) JESUS (name of individual). Jesus the individual gave up his life to teach us to do the same. If you knew the beauty that awaited you, you would crucify your ""ego"" in a heartbeat and wake up to eternal being you truly are. You don't kill your physical body; you kill your identity/""ego""/character/persona.

2428,"Our journey through life is not expected to be one smooth jolly ride. 

Skimming through the lives of some notable Bible characters such as Joseph, Tamar, Elijah, Job, Paul, Daniel, Moses and Even the life of our saviour Jesus christ here on earth this is evident. 

One thing Is certain about our journey through life there would be unexpected twists, turns, curves, bumps and even crashes however, if Jesus is at the centre of it all we would certainly have a safe landing and the trip would only bring us to an expected end. 

 If i had the privilege to interview  the above characters to inquire whether they would have had their lives journey any other way I am certain they wouldn't!
You know why? Because they see the big picture now; lives where saved, they where refined and prepared through their journey.

Whatever you are dealing with presently,  rest in the knowledge that there Is a big picture, God has a plan and you would arrive at an expected end. all you need to do is keep jesus at the centre.

2434,"I have a friend who is a Protestant but is slowly becoming a Catholic. I asked him about the book of Enoch but he told me that he doesn't believe in and claims that it was written by people who were trying to paint Christianity in a bad light. I was reading the book a bit and came across the part regarding the angels teaching humans forbidden knowledge, sleeping with human women and cross breeding animals to create ""abominations"". The thing is, the book definitely has very controversial stuff but nothing that isn't impossible. The angels in Christianity are known to have free will and 1/3 did rebel. I'm not sure why my friend said that it paints Christianity in a bad light since it doesn't look down on God but it is a very controversial text.

I looked into a few other apocryphal texts and there was one claiming that Mary Magdalene gave birth to two of Jesus children. From what I can tell Apocryphal texts claim stuff that are very controversial but not impossible. "

2442,"So, as the title kinda says, I’m about to ask about some pretty crazy things that have happened to me during prayer and I’m not sure what to think about it. 

About 2 weeks ago, I was alone in a dead quiet cabin. I was praying before going to bed. Immediately after I heard a female voice I did not recognize say my name in my right ear. I wasn’t overly tired, wasn’t drinking or anything. I have also never had anything like this happen before. 

This happened again over this past weekend. Once again I was alone but this time I was at home. Still in a very quiet room. This time tho, I’m pretty sure I recognized my great grandmothers whispering voice. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar? Does anyone have any idea what I have experienced? Or what does it even mean?? I have been told that God will usually speak to us through actions, rather than words so what the heck happened? 

Any input is appreciated."

I'll start: I go to the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There is a bus I take that goes directly to the gym, and there's a bus that goes directly home. I said to God that I didn't want to go to the gym that day and I was gonna go home and relax. When I got to the bus stop, the bus that took me to the gym pulled up and I didn't get on it. And then, a bus pulled up right after it that would take me to the gym. I knew it was a sign in that moment, because the same bus numbers that take me to the gym never come after one another immediately. So that second bus goes without me on it. Then comes the bus that would take me home... and it drives right past me, causing me to wait 10 extra minutes to get home. And I just had to laugh about it because, like a true dad, He wants me to be better even if that means teaching me annoying lessons. Seriously, I love Him. "

I am looking to go to an episcopal church because I heard they are very tolerant (I am LGBT) but I have no idea about their values past that. My questions is what should I expect at my first service? Is it possible for me to just slip in and go unnoticed (I have anxiety and really don’t like the idea of drawing attention to myself). Is Wednesday service the same as Sunday service? Should I bring my own Bible? How early prior to the services (10am) should I arrive? Tbh I could just use some general advice on anything.

The suffering of Jesus seems to be one of the most important pillars of the faith, but I cant understand why.

Why is the act of appearing in bodily form and suffering for humanity seen as a graceful redeeming act when humans themselves have been through greater pain? "

I was legally considered homeless for a year before meeting him, and had moved in with my Aunt and Uncle to escape a difficult home life/ongoing abuse. A few months back, I was suddenly kicked out of that home and moved in with him as I couldn’t afford to live on my own, and have no relatives in the State. As one can imagine, we have had sex since then. He has said openly
to me that he considers me his wife before God, and I consider him to be my husband. When we are in a better financial situation, I truly believe he plans to legally marry me, or at least have a pastor officiate a marriage. However, I’ve been dealing with tremendous guilt after reading how severely God views fornication. I had no idea it was such a grave sin. Am I living in sin?

I met God vividly in an NDE in 2014 on Easter - the commemoration of the day He was crucified ..

He literally resurrected me onto a hospital bed, way to preach to me right?

He said, ""your time isn't now"" when I was in the light at the end of the tunnel.

Apart from very graphic images of hell and satanic warfare, His peace and love was overwhelming.

Since then, He visits me every day and tells me He loves me, to keep going, to persevere.

He explains scripture to me every single time I'm reading, He brings me to tears everytime I'm praising Him.

His forgiveness keeps echoing in my heart..

His love detaches me from carnal things, yet drives me to hate sin as He commanded - yet love all.

I have never felt alone, even in tribulations..

Has anyone else experienced these kinds of blessings?"

It has made me at times resent other people and grow sort of happy with other peoples misfortunes. I also feel bitter towards God at times because of the pathetic existence I live and the fact that I have to put up with this loneliness. I've been trying to keep it in but it seems like a regular occasion now where I just cry twice a week, which was pretty uncommon for me up until now.  

I feel at the moment I want to end my life, but I don't want to be judged and go to Hell. I realize I need to change my mindset because its leading me to a poor spiritual life and uncharity, but I need help on how to accept my loneliness as a result. It would help if the advice wasn't ""go volunteer"" or tips about how to ""make friends"" because its not like I'm actively avoiding that. What I'm looking for is a way to cope with my loneliness, not the loneliness of not having a girlfriend, but not even having a friend to talk to. I feel like I am going to explode if I don't get advice, there's not many Catholic resources available on the Internet about this because most of it relates to dating life, not just being a total outcast which makes me feel like an even bigger loser.

Plus, science has shown us that the brain is making decisions about what we are going to do or think before it even happens: [https://qz.com/1569158/neuroscientists-read-unconscious-brain-activity-to-predict decisions#:\~:text=Neuroscientists%20have%20long%20known%20that,a%20foundation%20of%20free%20will](https://qz.com/1569158/neuroscientists-read-unconscious-brain-activity-to-predict-decisions#:~:text=Neuroscientists%20have%20long%20known%20that,a%20foundation%20of%20free%20will).

Next, each brain is different. We know that brains are wired differently and are affected by either nature or nuture. The brain of a sex addict is markedly different than a non-sex addict. Take another example, the University of Texas bell tower shooter.  We know that **Charles Whitman had a brain tumor pressing on his amygdala**, a region of the brain crucial for emotion and behavioral control. How is he responsible for what he thought about and then committed if he couldn't stop himself?"
2461," As for me, I wish my next tears will be tears of joy, a result of immense happiness.   
I hope to stop being afraid of disappointing others and instead, courageously strive to excel in everything I do.   
I want to face life’s challenges with resilience, refusing to be overwhelmed by the pressures they bring.   
Moreover, I desire to rely less on others and more on God who gives me life and provides for all my needs. "
2462,"Hello I started going to church in the start of this year. I had been depressed and tired and hopeless for a few years. My brother had been a church goer for a while and has always been a good guy with a good family, I thought it was time for a change so I decided to go. The word has been amazing and rejuvenating, the people are fantastic and loving. I’m focused on getting my life back together and learning what it means to a man of god ( I’m in a bibles study right now). 

 Im a very logical person and I want to believe so bad and how my heart wants so badly for god to exist but I feel that’s what makes me hesitate and fear that god isn’t real. I want there to be some confirmation/affirmation that’s gods real. I still struggle with sexual desire and some days I succeed and some days I fail. The days I fail is usually when my faith is low. I want very deeply to love and be loved like how 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 says. 

I’ve prayed many times for god to reveal himself to let me hear his voice and to come to me in a dream, to feel his Holy Spirit anything for that “supernatural” proof of god something that I can hold onto. I’ve fasted seeking it gotten down on my hands and knees, face full of tears and heart full of repentance. I know Jesus says in john 20:29 to Thomas  “ because thou hast seen me thou believed, but blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed” I want to believe with out seeing and my life turnaround but what’s to say the Bible not just a really good self help book. even with this doubt I praise god anytime something good happens or when I need strength. The worst part is if god is real then I fear he doesn’t want me and he doesn’t want any part of me. John 6:31 says “no man can come to me, except the father which hath he sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day”

 Am I being a spoiled brat asking to have it my way? all the support helps thank you for taking the time to read and respond. Have a blessed day!"
2463,"hey guys, so me and my wife (both 19) just signed our marriage certificate yesterday and are officially married by law. i have a couple of questions tho. i’ll explain some things before asking the questions. 

so she has been living in an unclean, filthy, toxic, and i’d even say abusive home. we’ve known for a long time that we were gonna marry each other, and we had planned on november of next year but because of a change in plans, and talking to my family, we signed the marriage certificate yesterday, and she’s gonna move in my house with me in november after our honeymoon. my first question is, even tho we got married by law, are we married in God’s eyes? because Christ said that marriage is when a man leaves his father and mother and be united to his wife. does “leave his father and mother” mean actually leave them or does it mean to become mature and make decisions like marrying the woman you love and believe God has put you with?

my second question is pretty simple but heavy. she and i slipped up before marriage. i guess we were deceived and believed we were married in God’s eyes even tho we weren’t married by law. we haven’t had penetrative sex, so technically we are virgins, but i’m feeling this sense of sadness and fear because we believed for so long it was ok and we lived in sin while trying to follow God. obviously we have repented and changed for Christ, but what do i need to do about this? because i know we’re both excited, but i just feel like it’s wrong for us to have sec now and kinda tying the first question in, i don’t feel truly married to her and i don’t know why. maybe we need to consummate our marriage first, but any and all advice will be greatly appreciated. feel free to ask questions to ask me to clarify if i wasn’t unclear on some things. thank you."
2464,"Sorry if it sounds petty, but my dog has an issue with her leg. The vet thinks she's done an acl unity and is going into get x-rays tomorrow. If it's bad she'll need surgery (which we can barely afford) and will need to be kept still and calm for up to 8 weeks... She's a 4 year old labrador though. 

I'd really love for her to not need surgery, please pray that she'll be ok

Thanks a lot 💜"
2465,"I think I’ll start first and be warned my reasoning is a little silly, but I feel like I should share it anyway I heard news that there was this movie that would not get released until 100 years starring John Malkovich, and made by Robert Rodriguez, called 100 years apparently it’s to advertise some alcohol that apparently gets aged every 40 or 100 years called Louis 13 and I know it sounds silly, but it honestly made me fear about mortality, and all that so much so that I had a panic attack the night after I found out and so I eventually decided to download a Bible app, and I have been feeling better since then especially after talking to my parents, talking to a therapist and going to the farm to see the animals things have been getting better and I realize that life has been moving fast and it really scared me and that’s why it kept me up at night and so I’m just wanting to know if something similar has ever happened to you guys? And if so have you decided to reconnected with God and Christianity?"
2468,"Hello everyone! I hope you all are doing amazing 🙏🏻🤍 anyways i just wanted to share my story with you guys, I grew up in a Muslim house but we were never too religious, i never ever had a connection with Islam and i really did not feel like it was a faith i wanted to follow, anyways so few months ago i was really depressed and was going through so much problems , one night i was scrolling on instagram and suddenly i see a post that was a bible verse : Matthew 11:28-30 “28 “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.”  For some reason this verse made me feel so many emotions that i couldn’t explain, so since that night, I started digging deeper into christianity and started to learn more about it! I really found peace with Christ my Lord and Savior! At first it was hard to accept that Jesus was God & Son of God since in Islam it is taught that he was a “prophet” & that God has no son, and that if you ever leave islam you will go to hell forever! but now i’m more than proud to say that YES JESUS is GOD AND is the SON OF GOD!! & IM HIS FOLLOWER  & also i bought my first ever bible (NRSV) few days ago!! I’m so happy for this new journy! I feel safe and loved with Jesus 🙏🏻 thank you all for listening to me!! & May God bless every single one of you!"
2469,"Just a few tips for people around my age ie. teenagers who feel like there is barely anyone with real faith their age.

Firstly, look up the story of elijah who felt EXACTLY how you felt (1 Kings 19:9-18)

We're right here!!!

This is just my small teenage church in the UK, but rest assured there are definitely Chrisitan young people serving God and passionate too!

But tbh, there's nothing better than real life Christian friends to encourage you. So make sure to let your light shine - ie. let others know you're a Christian bc it's likely there are other believers out there feeling the same as you do and someone needs to make the first move so you can connect.

2471,"I (14m) recently lost my girlfriend (14f) to another guy (14m) and it’s all because I never hung out with her in private. She wanted to get intimate and makeout and stuff but I never caved in to temptation, I never told her about how I wasn’t gonna fall into sin, she just thought I was boring and a pussy. She ended up leaving me for another guy and a week later I get a no caller Id of two people having sex and laughing, I instantly recognized her voice. It was her and this new guy. She said she wasn’t gonna block me on anything but I blocked her on everything. I feel bad but I don’t anymore. I am at a low point in my life, I am always thinking about her. Whenever I walk past her in the hallways with her new guy they both laugh at me. I treated her like gold, we both liked the same music, same movies, same hobbies, and she was a pretty girl too. She’s all I think about when I try to sleep or focus in class. I wrestle and I lift so I know I’m not ugly or a loser. It sucks knowing I treated her better than any other guy would have my age. Everybody talks about how they would fuck her and stuff but I loved her for her. I know I am still young and will meet new people but I need advice to get over her and stop thinking about her."
2472,"Look what they try to do to us. Protect your kids while you still can. It is never too late.

Go to google translate, write ""Nic kelo deo""(ofc Nickelodeon) and convert Latin to English.

If you want another example, same languages, write ""Baal enci aga""(ofc Balenciaga). 

See both translations. All who read the Bible will understand. I encourage anyone to look up John Ramirez testimony. You cant convince me this is just an accident.

2473,"Two years ago my oldest and gorgeous little daughter got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when she was 3. Since that day I've struggled. Genuinely the worst day of my entire life. Thinking back on it just make my whole body crumble. I've condemn Him. I've lost trust in Him. Even hated Him at times. And I'm sorry for it, but every night I just lay watching her sleep while I shed a tear trying to figure out why things happen to such perfect and innocent beings. I just don't get it. I'm struggling to wrap my head around how God would allow for something like this to happen. I'm not trying to say I have it worse than anyone else or that people don't have it worse - I live in a country that has a really good health care. So I guess that's a blessing.. How can I get back to God and Jesus. I used to enjoy their company so much? How can I rationalize all of this? I just want to take her chronic disease and let her live a normal life. I'd take it, within a heartbeat...quick! Someone please give me a few words of encouragement or whatever. I'm really struggling with this.. 

Pce n love

Edit: Just to make this abundantly clear; I'll manage. This isn't really about me. I'm just gut-wrenchingly heartbroken that my daughter has to go through this for the rest of her life. That she will feel different. That she just can't be spontaneous as I was in my teen/young adult years. She will always have to have it the back of her head that she has to take care of it."
2475,I want to follow the lord in every way however when I commit sinful acts I do not feel guilty or ashamed when praying I tell the lord that I do not feel guilt or shame for my sinful acts and I ask him to fix me to once I was but I feel that I will always remain from who I was and I feel that I won’t be accepted by Christ for my heart isn’t genuine and because of that I think that I will be told depart from me for I never knew you when my time has ended and be thrown down to the firey pits of hell for all of eternity
2476,"I was arguing with a person about praising an artist because of something he commited or some threats and abuse he did and in that instant I went into a very long monologue and I wanted to somehow understand why these things existed to begin with, its then where I finally understood.

hate the sin, not the sinner, all beings are originally pure, imagine I have a computer and I feed this computer certain code lines and I program it a certain way, now when the computer executes its tasks, it will always work according its original programming almost mechanically, if you use a computer to do whatever task, the computer itself has no control, it does have control over some things but those same things were programmed into it for it to do it by itself

Now take this and use it as a Frame to understand the Human mind, I subscribe to this philosophy of my own, Every single human being is simply a product of their environment, external matters, even their very own self is a program, not as in mechanical but as in it reflects what its been fed to it, if a child is born in africa, he will act african and be african, if he is european, he will act european, now this same child might be born european but act african but again its because of some factor or outside influence, a child of a murderer might turn into a murderer or he may not, if he does he was influenced by his father, if not then some other external factor came into play to move him away from it, even that feeling of ""Oh I am going to change my life and stop doing evil"" is itself another programming as a result of the environment and the human brain's own programming, even that very sense of self, of I am this and I am not that

in this way, All Beings are Pure and all Beings are Robots basically, there is no evil and no good, Everything is just like a computer running, all beings are like this, the murderer and his murder is simply an action made by a human brain through everything it has been exposed to, the action from a mind to another mind according to its programming

even that feeling of pain and pleasure, of hatred even intense and of love is itself another programming, another something that is due to being programmed as a human mind, even that feel, that hope, that despair, that depression, all the programming of a human mind

your hatred of murder is your human brain depising one hurting another one of your kind, its because you see yourself as a human being that you despise murder, but if it was lets say eating meat, you wouldnt feel a thing, even if you were vegan, that feeling of empathy is itself a programming of a human mind

and I am saying this from a human mind meaning its a human mind that has recognised itself to be a computer basically, when you see this you can see clearly and are no longer deluded by emotions or programmed reactions

all beings are Pure, the world is the Problem, the world if I use human thoughts emotional frame is evil, the world does not care about beings and beings themselves are alone and exist seperately and are even made/programmed to eat each other to survive, now this is not a problem in itself, the problem is that human beings are contradictory to the nature of the world, so there is an inherent clash of ideals, thus human ideals and the world cannot be reconciled and the nature of the world as uncaring and savage is also part of human beings, thus greed, lust and all the atrocities which again are not actually atrocities since we deemed all human ideals as merely programming either from evolution, maybe even god, no one knows, the nervous system's response to pain and even the very sense of self and the reactions are all a product and programming akin to a computer, all fake down to the last detail.

All beings are absolutely pure, there is no sin nor a possibility of sinning since sinning or not sinning is both the computer of the brain taking action, it is only from the pov of human beings that we see these things as sin or not sin when they are just that, decisions taken according to the programming of the brain + outside circumstances and environment

everything you like or dislike is the exact same way, Seeing this either as depressing or joyful is also the human mind, a mind that has gone beyond being a human mind neither approves nor disapproves anything, Anything. neither likes nor dislikes anything.

when you root out all beliefs, all that remains is Being, you remain without thoughts and without thoughts there is no self

without a self, all that remains is purity, just being empty of all thoughts, judgments and even sense of self, isn't that the Kingdom of heaven jesus talked about?

2477,"On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many deeds of power in your name?' Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; go away from me, you evildoers. what does this mean exactly does it mean that their faith wasn't enough did it mean that they didn't love god with all their fiber of their being? sorry if im asking dumb questions it's something that bugged me all day"
2478,"Ive been really struggling with sexual urges, but i would really not like to tell them that"
2479,"Their only argument is that God can't be real because bad things happen on earth. Like as if ""bad"" things happening automatically proves God doesn't exist. 

It's as if they are just looking for an excuse to not believe in God and when a ""bad"" thing happens they grab it. 

*""uh oh earthquake in Asia. God's not real. Checkmate Christians!""*

OR

*""According to the bible, God flooded the earth. That's a bad thing, so this means God doesn't exist""*

Like seriously it's the same old argument over and over."
2481,"At a bible study people were listing good stories to tell children, and after mentioning king David one woman said to make sure to include about how he is a rapist.

This was a bit of a shocking statement but I can kind of see where she is coming from, look at 2 Samuel 11 in the NRSVUE everyone please:

>In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel with him; they ravaged the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem.  
>  
>It happened, late one afternoon when David rose from his couch and was walking about on the roof of the king’s house, that he saw from the roof a woman bathing; the woman was very beautiful. David sent someone to inquire about the woman. It was reported, “This is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” So David sent messengers to get her, and she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she was purifying herself after her period.) Then she returned to her house. The woman conceived, and she sent and told David, “I am pregnant.”

After this he kills Uriah, but this is the rape part.

Am I right? Am I reading into the text? I never heard this idea before, input is welcome!

Also, tw: rape, sa, murder, etc"
2482,"I am having intense anxiety about the need to make promises to God. I feel that if I don't, that I am not a true Christian. I feel like my anxiety will significantly decrease if I verbally make a promise to Jesus that I will follow him the best that I can, that I am willing to be made willing. The main reason behind wanting to make this promise is to calm down my religious OCD. *I also think it's because I think I am saying it for selfish gain like expecting blessings (health & no more anxiety!!) deep down in my sub-conscious because I'm a human and I'm tired of my stress, anxiety, and everything man.*

**I don't know if this is Satan or what, but I get thoughts in my mind like this. ""What if you are not truly willing?"" ""Are you sure you want to follow that difficult and scary road, are you really willing to be made willing?"" The other thing that confuses me is that Philippians 2:13 says: for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure**.

Deep down in my heart, I believe that I am still willing to be made willing, but the way my OCD and mind works is that I need confirmation from someone or something that I am willing to be made willing all the time. I think the fears and doubts become so high that it makes me doubt myself and whether I am living up to my promise, but still despite this feeling I would rather be crushed, transformed, have whatever happen so I do God's will than reject Jesus and never have him in my life. **The thought of not having Jesus in my life is terrifying to me**.

I keep on telling myself that deep down in my heart, I know I am willing to be made willing. It's just this constant battle of thoughts is too much. I just did a PET Scan yesterday for the 3rd time to see if my cancer is clear, and I have no hope it is clear because I have been under so much stress since 2018. I am at the end of myself.

I have done everything in regards to seeing priests, I am on medication and seeing a therapist, I have ended up deleting and making Reddit accounts because I get frustrated then need help again. **OCD is not fun.**"
2483,"a couple days ago i was laying down after the gym and all of a sudden i felt empty and alone. i don’t know what happened to me but the feeling won’t stop, should i just focus on my faith and try to ignore it? or should i pray for it to go away, but i feel kinda selfish to to try to think of praying for this"
2484,"I’m 23 female and come from a broken family essentially. 
I have good friends and church friends, youth and young adults that’s I see weekly/ Sundays and Wednesdays . And Thursday sometimes 

Every time I met someone I like I want them to be in my life forever and I get sad when they are not, most of my friends are from church like I said above I go to a charismatic Pentecostal loud church, so since I was 18 I’ve been in that loop with these people that love God so maybe my relationships at church might be a bit different bc they are Christ centred .
For example I meet someone that can be a boy or girl, theirs my workmates I love them and they are so cool I want to be in their lives forever and hangout, they probably don’t feel the same but I don’t know, (I kinda felt like cause at church I would constantly see my friends or the same youths/young adults years at a time, it would be similar) 
Theirs this other girl who isn’t a Christian but I want to be friends with her, we have exchanged ig and talk, I want to be friends with her but I don’t want to force it ( it’s not like tryna to convert her or anything I just actually like her company and we vibe and we have similar personalities.  

This feeling makes me a bit standoff ish sometimes and not want to build relationships outside of my church community because they might not want me Ig 
Why am I so attached to people to the point I’m heart broken after a 1 month friendship and we don’t talk anymore or when somebody leaves the  job"
2485,"I went vegan because of how I felt animals were unethically treated in factories and how they are raised and slaughtered. I’m all for eating animals, as long as they are raised and slaughtered ethically. But then I wonder, what is the ethical way to raise and slaughter animals? And I can’t figure it out. The Bible doesn’t seem to be clear on how to do this. And so now I’m living life having sorta anxiety attacks throughout the day driving my car, or sleeping, saying “is the ceiling in my house ethically made, where animals killed from the sourcing of the concrete, is it a sin to sleep in my room and stare at the ceiling?” And then I worry about that, and i do the same thing with food, driving, even just going for a walk on a bike path wondering if it’s wrong to use a bike path that was built through the woods and may cause harm to wildlife. I have a feeling I’m overthinking a lot of things, but my issue is that I can’t explain how some things are ok when I can’t find specific things that say they are in The Bible. And many people have told me “you have to just let it go, you have to eat meat”- and so on. But most of these people are the same people who don’t seem to care about animals being treated unfairly. Or maybe it’s that they do care and just have accepted they can’t do much. I think that’s what it probably is more so. I feel trapped not feeling comfortable eating, trying new things in life, and find my self sad that I can’t really do much. I know this life is nothing compared to Heaven, but I’m almost positive I could feel way better than I feel now and have almost no anxiety one day. Also I have been told I have OCD, which I agree with, but you know sometimes it can be harder to reason with people when your actually right because they may use your anxiety as a way to say your overthinking it when sometimes you are not. I’ve asked people about if I should go vegan or not on here before and most answers were along the line of yes, but I just have this feeling that there’s something I’m not understanding or some key Bible verse I am not fully grasping that most Christians understand or use to say you don’t have to be vegan even if the animal is treated poorly, but I also want to learn what is considered unethical for animals. Thank you to everyone who replied and helped , and sorry for any grammar problems if there are. as I’m typing this my phone is glitchy."
2486,Why is it the belief of Catholics that water baptism is necessary for salvation when multiple passages argue otherwise? Biggest example is the thief on the cross. I’m not against baptism for salvation but baptism of the holy spirit not of water.
2487,"So I'm 20, and today I just found out something very sad today. I feel like I should ask this sub out of any other sub in mind

When I was in pre school back in 2007/2008, there was a girl who was very sick and died from some illness. Apparently, she really loved me a lot, and after she died, her grandma brought my mom a box of toys from her. She said it was a gift to your son from her, she really loved him she said.

My whole life I never knew this. Like, I always remembered her, just how she looks, and thought my mom just liked her personally, and how she kind of liked is or something, and thats all. But apparently it wasn't like that. She passed away around that year and really loved me without me even knowing. I don't get why it was like this, like i was very shy and socially anxious very badly. I'm confused how this even happened, like why she was so into me, someone like me.

As I found this out today what really happened... I feel very sad only finding this out at 20. That back when I was 4 or so, a sick and dying girl really loved me, and made me a dying gift and I never even knew that until now. My mom seen her in preschool recess, and saw how she coughed unusually and had mucus in her nose, and wondered how she even is at school. My guess pneumonia?

So is she like in heaven, is she awaiting me? Or might she found someone else in heaven and doesn't care about me anymore and i shouldn't dwell on it? I'm not sure how to deal with this shocking sad news I just found out today. Her grandma said she really loved me after she died of her illness. Even gave me a gift. I never even remembered/knew of this until now. Like if time goes by much faster in heaven, like 1 day in heaven is like 1000 years on earth... that means she has only been in heaven for several/or few dozen minutes? If she passed away loving me that much, that must mean she is still looking forward to seeing me?

Sorry if this wasn't well written or sound weird, I'm very sad of what happened, and am ashamed how i was soo shy and socially anxious I never payed attention to whats going on around me and that I had a dying girl on her mind to death, where she even made a gift me and told her mom/grandma to give to me after she passes. She probabaly mistook my disability as an impression of rude or not caring, which is even sadder. Man... I need some specific perspective on this, this is too sad for me to bare just like that. I feel guilty for being soo shy and socially anxious, that I wasn't even able to see/or accept this for some reason."
2489,"I used to have so many dreams of flying. I'd feel so free  and many times I'd use it as a shortcut. Either to get to somewhere quicker or to escape something that was chasing me. Sometimes I'm stuck, inconvenienced in a situation or bored. Then it's like ""oh I forgot I can do this"" and float off the ground. Last night was one of those times. Except this time I was around family. I was around my mom and my aunt. 

Remembered I could fly and tried it inside at first before showing them. Then I told them to come outside and I had to show them something. I had my feet leave the ground and they had a look almost like they were surprised but moreso afraid. It was limits to how high I could go and I tried to oush as high up as I could. I got to about 3 feet off the ground.

 I kept telling them to look at me. I remember exactly what it felt like physically. It really felt like pushing myself in a sense. Snd the more I did it, the harder it felt to do. In the dream I could move my arms while off the ground but it felt like they were being held to stay still I had to strain so hard to move them. And on the inside it felt like my body was being contorted from the neck down. My family didn't want me doing that.

 It's a lady I have to ask my family about that now looking back, used to practice witchcraft. There is no coming back after you pass. And for her to say she could speak to my grandmother while just a few feet from her body was evil of her. (She was at the viewing). 

She was in my dream just standing there smiling. It felt unnatural and at one point like I was being suspended by sometjing other than me. I'm a firm believer thY witchcraft is real and can disguise itself as something we want to do, feel, see  or hear. I have some cleansing to do and conversations that need to be had."
2491,"“A Bible believed to be 1,500 years old challenges the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, proposing that it was Judas who was crucified by Roman soldiers. This ancient text, known as the Gospel of Barnabas, recently surfaced in Turkey's Ethnography Museum of Ankara, causing significant controversy, particularly within the Vatican. The book, hidden since its 2000 discovery, contains unconventional claims about Jesus, his crucifixion, and divinity. This article delves into the content of this ancient Bible, its disputed authenticity, and its potential impact on Christian teachings.”

I saw this post on Twitter. May anyone debunk this Gospel? Thank you."

Matthew 6:33 

But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.

Matthew 13:24

Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:

Luke 8:11

Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

Mark 16:15

And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.  

(Anyone interested my Instagram is on this link) has most of my art chronologically from like when I was 12 till now. What’s strange is I wasn’t always a “full on believer” and you can somewhat see the strange progression and the subtle and not so subtle seeds of faith that got me more interested into the faith and what was also watered by other believers later on)

2495,"“And the Head of Days came with Michael and Raphael and Gabriel and Phanuel, and thousands and tens of thousands of angels without number. And he came to me and greeted me with his voice and said to me, “You (are) that Son of Man who was born for righteousness, and righteousness dwells on you, and the righteousness of the Head of Days will not forsake you.”

Some say that the proper translation is “he is the son of man”. But that only comes from RH Charles who himself admited its not an accurate translation, but him trying to change it to fit Christian doctrine. 

Some people say that Enoch is A son of man instead of THE son of man, but it sounds too similar to THE son of man when described in chapter 46:

“This is the Son of man, to whom righteousness belongs; with whom righteousness has dwelt; and who will reveal all the treasures of that which is concealed: for the Lord of spirits has chosen him; and his portion has surpassed all before the Lord of spirits in everlasting uprightness.”

Both described in the same way with the same terminology."
2496,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I had an ego death where I experienced the unity of God for an eternal amount of time and an infinite bliss. I heard a voice in my head say ""Do you want to stay here?"" and I responded ""No"" because I knew that I couldn't just die and leave my family to suffer.

&#x200B;

This is written in the Apochryphon of John-

""I said, Master, where will the souls go of people who had knowledge but turned away?

He said to me, They will be taken to the place where the angels of misery go, where there is no repentance. They will be kept there until the day when those who have blasphemed against the spirit will be tortured and punished eternally.""

Do you think that, since I turned down the choice to stay in the egoless state of knowledge, that I will be condemned to an eternity in hell?

&#x200B;

Thanks!

2497,"**^(I'm saying this to believers especially catholics, since not many christians believe in sainthood (for some reason), so if you do not believe in Jesus just keep scrolling down and don't mind with this.)**

Some people ask why there's fewer saints today than used to be in the past and I don't think it is because people are losing their faith but actually these times are softening our perceptions.

There is much more comfort today than it used to be in the past when we needed to form communities in order to survive the winter, plagues or warring periods and etc, today many people don't have these needs (much more common that we join social gatherings for fun or for having opportunities, but not for survival like used to be). You can order food and drinks at any moment, you don't need to walk many miles because Uber exists, you can communicate instantly with others via internet and etc.

I'm not saying there isn't any saints in these times, just look at Blessed Carlo Acutis. But because people softened their perceptions and allowed to live like most of us do that there's fewer saints, we've lost the ideas of fasting, suffering for Christ, hardwork and feeling thankful to God for our lives and gifts.

I mean if there is one thing Christianity is about, is 'suffering'. Just look at every saint's life there's too much pain and sadness, how can we desire to become saints ourselves without ever suffering like they did? I'm not talking about letting be martyrized because this would be not only stupid but sinful and evil, i'm talking about doing the small things like fasting (avoiding tasty food or eating many times a day) and other forms of penitence, or attitudes like humiliating yourself, avoid some luxuries."

I also want to make sure the verses speak to a middle school/high school audience - comfort, peace, friendship, selflessness, faith, etc.  My hope is that it inspires them to look up the verses in a time of need and will resonate with them, rather than a make-them-roll-their-eyes “yeah I know this one already” vibe.

2504,"TLDR: Is a lack of strong desire normal in a Christian marriage? What does the Bible say about intimate marital relations?

My husband and I dated purposefully, and we just knew — God was specifically calling my husband into our relationship. We have now been married for just over a year, and I’d consider it a Kingdom match. :)

I have since grappled with intimacy with him. I came to Jesus in my early twenties, ~ 2018. Before, I was immoral, and my husband was as well before he felt a wrenching conviction from the Spirit to change his ways.

I do not feel strong desire for my husband in that way, and he doesn’t particularly seem to feel that overwhelmingly for me either. We are both healthy and attractive, we spend loads of quality time together, yet we are intimate once or twice a month. I am curious if this is an effect of our past and subsequent repentance, or a normal state of being.

What does the Bible say about intimate marital relationships? Is this normal, or should I be doing something to provide more for my husband in this way?"

With my ADHD I learned I have low impulse control which means its harder for me to sin, especially for impure urges. Though despite seeing this as a curse I realized its a gift from when I was created. For my ADHD and realizing of low impulse control helps power me to have even stronger control of my emotions and urges. To conquer my impure heart and strive to have a stronger relationship with god. 

Though despite my ADHD and with more testing I believe when I go to church, especially when Im close to the tabernacle. Im truly at peace and worry very little or sometimes not at all about my past sins. For I have finally found the peace I been searching for my entire life.

Saint [Dionysius](https://images.oca.org/icons/lg/october/1003adionysiosarepegite.jpg) lived originally in the city of Athens. He was raised there and received a classical Greek education. He then went to Egypt, where he studied astronomy at the city of Heliopolis. It was in Heliopolis, along with his friend Apollophonos where he witnessed the solar eclipse that occurred at the moment of the death of the Lord Jesus Christ by Crucifixion. “Either the Creator of all the world now suffers, or this visible world is coming to an end,” Dionysius said. Upon his return to Athens from Egypt, he was chosen to be a member of the Areopagus Council (Athenian high court).

When the holy Apostle Paul preached at the place on the Hill of Ares (Acts 17:16-34), Dionysius accepted his salvific proclamation and became a Christian. For three years Saint Dionysius remained a companion of the holy Apostle Paul in preaching the Word of God. Later on, the Apostle Paul selected him as bishop of the city of Athens. And in the year 57 Saint Dionysius was present at the repose of the Most Holy Theotokos.

During the lifetime of the Mother of God, Saint Dionysius had journeyed from Athens to Jerusalem to meet Her. He wrote to his teacher the Apostle Paul: “I witness by God, that besides the very God Himself, there is nothing else filled with such divine power and grace. No one can fully comprehend what I saw. I confess before God: when I was with John, who shone among the Apostles like the sun in the sky, when I was brought before the countenance of the Most Holy Virgin, I experienced an inexpressible sensation. Before me gleamed a sort of divine radiance which transfixed my spirit. I perceived the fragrance of indescribable aromas and was filled with such delight that my very body became faint, and my spirit could hardly endure these signs and marks of eternal majesty and heavenly power. The grace from her overwhelmed my heart and shook my very spirit. If I did not have in mind your instruction, I should have mistaken Her for the very God. It is impossible to stand before greater blessedness than this which I beheld.”

After the death of the Apostle Paul, Saint Dionysius wanted to continue with his work, and therefore went off preaching in the West, accompanied by the Presbyter Rusticus and Deacon Eleutherius. They converted many to Christ at Rome, and then in Germany, and then in Spain. In Gaul, during a persecution against Christians by the pagan authorities, all three confessors were arrested and thrown into prison. By night Saint Dionysius celebrated the Divine Liturgy with angels of the Lord. In the morning the martyrs were beheaded. According to an old tradition, Saint Dionysius took up his head, proceeded with it to the church and fell down dead there. A pious woman named Catulla buried the relics of the saint.

The writings of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite hold great significance for the Orthodox Church. Four books of his have survived to the present day:

*On the Celestial Hierarchy*

*On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy*

*On the Names of God*

*On Mystical Theology*

*In additional, there are ten letters to various people.*

The book On the Celestial Hierarchies was written actually in one of the countries of Western Europe, where Saint Dionysius was preaching. In it he speaks of the Christian teaching about the angelic world. The angelic (or Celestial-Heavenly) hierarchy comprises the nine angelic Ranks:

Seraphim

Cherubim

Thrones

Dominions

Powers

Authorities

Principalities

Archangels

Angels

The account of the Synaxis of the Bodiless Powers of Heaven is located under November 8.

The purpose of the divinely-established Angelic Hierarchy is the ascent towards godliness through purification, enlightenment and perfection. The highest ranks are bearers of divine light and divine life for the lower ranks. And not only are the sentient, bodiless angelic hosts included in the spiritual light-bearing hierarchy, but also the human race, created anew and sanctified in the Church of Christ.

The book of Saint Dionysius On the Ecclesiastical Hierarchies is a continuation of his book On the Celestial Hierarchies. The Church of Christ, like the Angelic ranks, in its universal service is set upon the foundation of priestly principles established by God.

In the earthly world, for the children of the Church, divine grace comes down indescribably in the holy Mysteries of the Church, which are spiritual in nature, though perceptible to the senses in form. Few, even among the holy ascetics, were able to behold with their earthly eyes the fiery vision of the Holy Mysteries of God. But outside of the Church’s sacraments, outside of Baptism and the Eucharist, the light-bearing saving grace of God is not found, neither is divine knowledge nor theosis (deification).

The book On the Names of God expounds upon the way of divine knowledge through a progression of the Divine Names.

Saint Dionysius’ book On Mystical Theology also sets forth the teaching about divine knowledge. The theology of the Orthodox Church is totally based upon experience of divine knowledge. In order to know God it is necessary to be in proximity to Him, to have come near to Him in some measure, so as to attain communion with God and deification (theosis). This condition is accomplished through prayer. This is not because prayer in itself brings us close to the incomprehensible God, but rather that the purity of heart in true prayer brings us closer to God.

The written works of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite are of extraordinary significance in the theology of the Orthodox Church, and also for late Medieval Western theology. For almost four centuries, until the beginning of the sixth century, the works of this holy Father of the Church were preserved in an obscure manuscript tradition, primarily by theologians of the Alexandrian Church. The concepts in these works were known and utilized by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Dionysius the Great, pre-eminent figures of the catechetical school in Alexandria, and also by Saint Gregory the Theologian. Saint Dionysius of Alexandria wrote to Saint Gregory the Theologian a Commentary on the “Areopagitum.” The works of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite received general Church recognition during the sixth-seventh centuries.

Particularly relevant are the Commentaries written by Saint Maximus the Confessor (January 21). (trans. note: although many scholars suggest that the “Areopagitum” was actually written by an anonymous sixth century figure who employed the common ancient device of piously borrowing an illustrious name, this in no way diminishes the profound theological significance of the works.)

In the Russian Orthodox Church the teachings of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite about the spiritual principles and deification were at first known through the writings of Saint John of Damascus (December 4). The first Slavonic translation of the “Areopagitum” was done on Mt. Athos in about the year 1371 by a monk named Isaiah. Copies of it were widely distributed in Russia. Many of them have been preserved to the present day in historic manuscript collections, among which is a parchment manuscript “Works of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite” belonging to Saint Cyprian, Metropolitan of Kiev and All Rus (September 16) in his own handwriting.

According to one tradition, he was killed at Lutetia (ancient name of Paris, France) in the year 96 during the persecution under the Roman emperor Dometian (81-96). Today most scholars and theologians believe that Saint Dionysius the Areopagite did not die in Gaul, and that Saint Dionysius (or Denys) of Paris is a different saint with the same name.

Saint Demetrius of Rostov says that the Hieromartyr Dionysius was beheaded in Athens, and that many miracles were worked at his grave.

Who is the speaker in this verse ? And to whom was it directed to ?
Is it god or jesus ? 
2-Mark 12:32 : “Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him.
Is "" teacher "" refers to jesus ? And if yes, wouldn't this contradict the trinity ?

I decided in 2020(16 years old) that I wanted to take my faith seriously after I realized that I wasn’t actually following God correctly and was only doing what I’ve been taught to do my whole life. I was doing ok and even completed the whole Bible around that time, but I quickly went back to old patterns bc I just couldn’t form a connection with God. I wonder why it’s so hard for me to do so when I’ve read about him and gotten to know him through scripture about his character and love for me, but yet I find it so easy for me to fall in love with fictional characters from tv shows/movies and books. I know they aren’t real and their stories are fictional pieces, but I always find a way to care about them as if they were real. I thought maybe it’s because I can’t see, hear, or feel God, but technically it’s the same thing with these characters. Why can I connect with them but not God? It leaves me very frustrated during my walk with Christ and I’ve basically stopped trying bc of this."
2514,"friends, following the recent post here — regarding a Ugandan scam — i just wanted to give you all the heads up to be weary when sending money to Africans over the internet who are supposedly starving and in dire need of food. unfortunately, these people contrive these super sophisticated and believable scams: they’ll send you photos of them and their family, of the food they bought with the money, etc. it’s a systematic and very large-scale scam in Africa. 

i myself fell victim to one of them. someone from Gambia messaged me saying his parents were dead and he needed money to feed his siblings — i sent him $75 (give or take) over a few weeks period. he left me alone for a few months, but reached out again a few days ago. in an effort to get him to stop badgering and belaboring me with calls and messages, i asked him to reach out for help here. i feel terrible, because i don’t want ANYONE else to get scammed. 

as it would, as i send this i worry that it was indeed real, that these people are starving, and that i’m now going to be at fault if something does happen to them. even if it were real, i suppose it always best to send money to reputable charities, not to individuals. i’m so conflicted right now: on the one hand, i don’t want anyone to starve. on the other, i don’t want anyone to get scammed. 

anyhow, tread carefully, and God bless.

When I was just a little kid, something unexpected happened in my life - my parents got divorced. This change threw me into a whole new world where I didn't have the warmth and stability of a home. I was left wandering, never knowing where I'd end up next. I stayed with relatives, spent countless nights in temporary places, and in the loneliness of those dark nights, I missed my mom and dad more than ever. I longed for the warmth of a home, but I knew deep down that it was something I couldn't have anymore.

I couldn't understand why God let my family fall apart and why I had to wander alone. I remember crying out to God, ""Where is my home?"" But there was no answer, and I still haven't found one.

Preached to us for 10-15 minutes. And then after they “prayed for us” ask about my job, asked my wife if she was a “spiritual warrior”, whole time I’m just trying to get away from these people.

These paintings depict Mary as being a young woman in her early 20s. Most art of Jesus shows him as being a grown man in his early 30s. The weird part is when Mary and Jesus is in the same painting and Jesus is a grown man. These art pieces show Jesus as looking like a 30 year old man while His Mother Mary is shown as looking like a 20 year old woman even though she is presumed to be around 14 years older than him. Most sources claim that Mary was 14 when she had Jesus although newer denominations that align with current political viewpoints have increased her age to around 20. Either way she is meant to be 14 years older than he is so she should look like a middle age woman but this is almost never the case with literally only 3 paintings I could find. 

Is there a particular reason for this or is this just due to the fact that no one really knows what Mary should look like in her 40s considering that art of her has always depicted her as being young."

2540,"Hi! So there was a co worker who said (if I understood correctly) that Hitler was a good leader. I stopped talking  to him and he left the company. My ocd keeps bugging me saying stuff like “do you wish him good well in his life/career?” and I said idk but I have a feeling saying no, but should I say no? idk what to think. I also don’t want to support Hitler."
2541,I am reading 1st corinthians and fell confused when comparing 1st corinthians 8:7-8 with 1st corinthians 10:19-21. It seems Paul says that if you know the truth and your faith is strong you're good and not condemned but in chapter 10 he says the opposite that you can't partake of two different tables. Can someone shed insight on this for me?
2542,"I have two jobs, and my busy schedule has reduced the time I can spend reading the Bible and attending Sunday worship regularly. Because I've been absent from worship services multiple times, my brothers and sisters have started to judge me, thinking I'm becoming more worldly. It hurts me deeply, and I feel like they don't really understand me. Sometimes I want to explain myself to them, but then I also feel like it's not necessary. I love my jobs, and I pray to God in my heart while I work. I also thank God in my heart when I eat, and I maintain my daily morning and evening prayers. It's just that I have less time to read the Bible now. Does that mean I'm committing a sin by not attending Sunday worship regularly?"
2543,"“Father,

I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonne sugar coat it. You hurt me. You failed me. I lived for you. I moved for you. I consulted you in and for everything. I laid down my flesh day after day after day so that I may be fit to serve you... holy, righteous, and acceptable…

When he proposed to me, I turned him down
multiple times. I asked you over and over to show me signs; to tell me whether or not this man was my husband. And when you fnally provided what I thought to be a clear “yes”,
I went for it. Yet, you failed me. After 5 years, he left me because he was ""tired of being married”. Now, , I sit here; Feeling like an abandoned wife and an abandoned child, while everyone around me expects me to get up, go to church, serve, worship, and love you as if you didn't lead me down a path to my own destruction. 

I used to reason that maybe all of this happened according to your will... that it's all part of your divine plan. But how can that be so? You hate divorce. Even when I'm not actively sinning, I’m sinning if I am to ever find love again. If I am to ever remarry and finally have the children you promised me, my husband will be considered an adulterer. You call me damaged goods. You call me sin. And because I have married someone you gave me clearance to many, who abandoned me, I must suffer in singleness for the rest of my life in order to evade sin.

With this understanding, I sinned. Willfully, intentionally, consciously, and recklessly,
I sinned. For half a year, the woman who withheld herself for marriage, who saw her body as a temple, turned into the woman 
who used her body as a means to find healing from abandonment, as leverage to evade loneliness, and as a means to survive - to avoid homelessness, and to get her life back on track. She entertained the company and affection of men who used her, took advantage of her, and abused her in an attempt to fill a void as deep and as wide as her heart. I partook in these actions under the belief that if your were gonna see me as a sinner anyway, I might as well sin in wans ways that would ""fix"" or “help” me since you seemed to have turned your ear away from me.

I gave up trying because I felt like you gave up on me. You guided me into a sexless marriage and a marriage riddled with infertility, only for the man who vowed to love me “until death do us part"", be the very one to impose the parting that would lead to the death of the woman I once knew.

Today, I am a year and four months removed from the day my entire life fell apart. I have healed from the abandonment of my former spouse, but the pain and resentment I still hold for you burns within me.

I have met a man that I love. He is rough around the edges, but he treats me well. He makes me feel beautiful, desired, capable, smart, and  safe. However, he is not a Believer. You have told me countless times that I should not be with this man, but I am having a hard time following your directives given our history. I did this your way last time. Now, I have to do it my way.

Father, | still love you.
But, 
you hurt me so bad.

Sincerely,
Your Daughter”"
2546,"I’ve repented for an unknown burden in my chest I’ve been having. it makes me sad and feel far from God. I feel like it’s stopping me from feeling everything good about God that I used to feel. 

I’ve felt the Holy Spirit 2 weeks ago for the first time. my life changed drastically. (I changed b4 then though) I guess this feeling upon me makes me scared. It makes me feel like I’m not as close as I thought. It makes me feel like I’m in the same position I was before I redirected my life back to Christ. Empty. Lonely. Unheard.

Somehow, whenever I’m in repentance for this , it seems to go away temporarily or lessen. But the moment I’m out of prayer, it comes back. 

Regardless of me repenting, asking for it to be revealed, and asking for knowledge about why I could feel this way, nothing changes. 

I still feel the same. I constantly go into repentance for it. Like something is URGING ME to get on my knees and repent more. So I have. Same feeling. It doesn’t go away. What could this be?"

maker of heaven and earth,
of all things visible and invisible.

I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God,
born of the Father before all ages.
God from God, Light from Light,
true God from true God,
begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
through him all things were made.
For us men and for our salvation
he came down from heaven,
and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,

For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day
in accordance with the Scriptures.
He ascended into heaven
and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
He will come again in glory
to judge the living and the dead
and his kingdom will have no end.

I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
who has spoken through the prophets.

2552,"My whole life, I’ve always been against the idea of organized religion. Seeing how much pain and suffering it has caused in the world, it doesn’t seem to be what I would think God would want for us. 

I went to catholic school where we were made to go to mass several times a week. We were made to take religion courses and know the Bible.

This never took away my belief, but it made me resent what Christianity was. Because of this, I started believing that if there was a God, I wouldn’t want to believe in him if he requires me to worship him and apologize for myself. 

I’d want to believe a God that wants me to be the best person of myself and do good unto others without requiring that I visit him and donate money to him and tell other people that he is the only way and that they’re wrong if they don’t believe in him. 

Would a person like me still make it into heaven?"

2554,"The only reason I want anything to do with God is because I don’t want to go to hell. 

Other than to avoid punishment, why would I want anything to do with Him? 

I don’t care if God “loves” me, because I never feel his love. Only judgement. Only hate for being a sinner. I’m not saying God is unjust. I agree. I’m bad and deserve pain. I believe God is just. I’m not saying God is wrong or bad. 

God doesn’t take away my suffering though. 
God doesn’t make me happy. 
God forces me to live my “gift” of life - a life I do not want and wish I’d never had. 

There is nothing good about being in a relationship with God - it might stop you going to hell so it might prevent a negative - but there is nothing positive. 

I don’t want to go to hell. But I don’t care about being with God in heaven. I’d rather just not exist. 
I don’t want hell. But I don’t want God. I want happiness. And all there is is pain."

2557,"For context; Its obviously October and for all my years of living, everyone but Mostly me, are MAJOR halloween Fans. if youve seeb my last post, you know that i just started my walk around late May/Early June because my family is VERY lukewarm and i didnt even know how the Bible works until may.

For the past Months, ive been fighting about whether i should or should not Partake in halloween. I love halloween, because i love everything scary and LOVE horror movies (is that btw?) but after watching videos, i probably saw like 6/7 videos saying its ok but they all ended with 'intention' then the rest were why you shouldnt. i took the idea of 'its your intention' and ran with it. But recently, whenevrr the thought of Halloween is brought up, i feel my heart drop and my mood change (conviction?) and whenever my mom talks about it, she always brings up the ‘good intention’. After deep thought and praying Jesus I came to conclusion that I would not be celebrating Halloween this year. I came to conclusion before after me and my mom talked about it. She kind of convinced me to do Halloween again but today she came back a little bit angry and kind of stressed and she couldn’t be mad so I went upstairs and that’s what I figured out my whole ‘I’m not doing Halloween’ thing but then when I came upstairs she was making dinner and we’re having a little talk. She was kind of happy but then,  then I brought up to her that I wasn’t celebrated this year her new kind of changed and she asked why I told her how I felt convicted all that and she kept asking and repeating my question. She asked what my heart felt like and I told her I wanted to but I felt convicted to no again, I kinda got a little bit mad and then she started bringing up how it was written by men and all that then she ended off with ‘im not forcing you’ and left. She was a little mad and I kinda feel bad because we were Halloween buddies. Should I have waited?"

Are you willing to bring all your difficulties before God and depend on Him?

We would like to share some words of God with you.

God says, “It is very simple now: Look upon Me with your heart, and your spirit will immediately grow strong. You will have a path to practice, and I will guide your every step. My word shall be revealed to you at all times and in all places. No matter where or when, or how adverse the environment is, I will make you see clearly, and My heart shall be revealed to you if you look to Me with yours; in this manner, you will run down the road ahead and never lose your way.”"

So, what does holiness mean in this context, and is it truly attainable? This has been deeply troubling me. "
2564,"So, today I bought this pack of tarot cards, thinking that it was going to be a cool thing, owning them.

However, I don't believe in them. I don't believe in fortune telling, astrology and that kind of stuff. I don't even know or want to read them at all.

So, I just wanna know: Is it a sin to own tarots?

2566,So I’m trying to have a Halloween party but my mom said it’s evil and the devils holiday. I was never allowed to celebrate it as a kid but now that I’m an adult that pays bill this is getting ridiculous. My mom is cool with me having a party she doesn’t want it to be Halloween because it’s evil. I looked up the history of Halloween and the meaning behind it and nothing says it has anything to do with satan. I’ve talked to my mom about this and she just says “not everyone knows” or “wait until I find my proof I’ll show you” We talked about this weeks ago and I’m still waiting on the “proof” Do you guys celebrate Halloween? If not why?
2567,"I feel so unloved, unworthy, abandoned, rejected by God. I try to pray, read, repent, worship, and give thanks but do not connect with God at all. I feel so empty that I literally ask myself what the point of this is anymore. I haven't had faith in so long and just wanted to connect with God again but nothing I do seems to work. I beg God to help me but all I feel is just my anxiety swirling up getting worse and worse the more I ask. I just feel nothing at all and it makes it difficult to believe. Because I'm asking and not receiving. I weep every day because I feel like something is wrong with me or that I am hated by God. When I pray I always ask “Do you truly care about me?” And I feel nothing just nothing. It’s like just I can't trust him at all and that may be why I can’t grow closer to God. When I read God’s Word and see the promises that God gives to his people it makes me angry because I just can't experience the peace, comfort, or love he gives. It breaks my heart and I pray that someone else has also felt that before or been through this to tell me that I'm not like going crazy. Thank you all for listening 💜"
2568,"Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna): The Valley of Hinnom is a physical location outside of Jerusalem. In the Old Testament, particularly during the times of apostasy, this valley was a site where some Israelites engaged in idolatrous worship, which included the horrifying practice of child sacrifice to pagan deities like Molek.

Jeremiah 7:31: ""They have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire—something I did not command, nor did it enter my mind.""

The concept of child sacrifice is deeply unsettling and difficult to fathom for many, given the inherent innocence and vulnerability of children. Throughout history, and even in some instances today, this distressing practice has tragically occurred, underscoring the importance of awareness and protective measures for the most vulnerable among us.

In January 1992, Special Agent Kenneth Lanning of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit published a [comprehensive report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ahr74dj4VJ6__2SsmiwpquVyTy6hlgcX/view?usp=drive_link) examining allegations of ['Ritual' Child Abuse](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ahr74dj4VJ6__2SsmiwpquVyTy6hlgcX/view?usp=drive_link).

2573,"So i never knew love was a feeling until this, so im at church and im singing along with the worship and i raise my hands something ive never done before, it took alot to do that i jad a huge irrational fear of people judging me, but when i did this i felt this feeling that was so powerful, it was this beautiful feeling indescribable and i just knew it was love. A week or two later i was having an awful night and i was at my friends (lets call her heather) i was with heather and i asked her if i could lean my head on her shoulder, she said yes and that same feeling came back, how wluld you explain this? At the time i was dealing with demonic oppression, which has been confirmed by a priest, so my question is was this feeling from god or was it from the demonic, and if this feeling was from god what could it mean?"

2576,"A while ago, I remember waking up with the urge to open the bible and I mean URGE. It couldn't wait and I had to read it, I skimmed through it but I remember a verse. I don't remember it word for word but it mentioned a harvest season being appointed. 

I don't know what that is and I'm scared. Is it the season where I reap what I sow? If that is the case, then it is going to be the WORST season because of what I've done. I don't know but I am sure that I have reaped destruction. I wouldn't be surprised if I go through another depressive episode because of that. 

If I will reap what I sow, I won't feel good and it won't be a pleasant experience. Not to mention, it's almost going to be December. It was during this time that I became a believer of God. Not because someone told me about Him but because I was going to commit suicide. I could be reminded of that dreadful experience and it could be a problem, I just hope that I don't act on it this time. Is that what a harvest season is?"
2577,"Hi,

I am conflicted and need help with Biblical/Christian insight. I have been in a 5 year relationship with a man who I am very much in love with and invested in. I love his heart, his love for God, the way he loves and treats others around him, and his desire to service to name a few. Of course, the way he treats, loves, and cares for me as well as how him and I have grown together as a couple and spiritually. I'm sorry for this lengthy post, but I think context really matters, so I want to give background: him and I are both of South Asian (Indian) descent and both come from very strictly religious and toxic families (culture gets mixed with religion, so religion is used to justify cultural practices that are otherwise considered abusive). We had to keep our relationship a secret for a long time due to the toxicity of our culture and community and also my bf's fears of people finding out and blowing our relationship out of proportion because it is seen as a ""sin"" and is looked very down on in our community. My bf has succumbed to the culture more than I have (I will get to that in a little bit) which is why I say he was the fearful one. Out of respect for him, I honored the secrecy and privacy of our relationship.  

Now as for me: I grew up with an alcoholic and abusive father who would beat my mother, siblings, and I for years, did not let my sister and I attend public school, did not let my mother have her own money or car or driver's license, etc. Just very controlling. My dad's large family identifies as Christian, but support him to this day and believe that my mom and us did wrong because we should not have stood up to him the way we did but instead just pray for him to change while enduring his control and abuse. After years of enduring this, my sister and I decided to stand up to my dad when we found out he had been cheating on my mom for years and subsequently when my sister came forward about her relationship with her now husband who is also Christian. I cannot express all the things that happened for this to occur, but I will say that my dad has basically disowned my sister (refuses to speak to her or acknowledge her) and he has also stopped talking to me because I supported her. The Indian Christian community we are from is a relatively small one wherein almost everyone knows each other, even if not everyone attends the same church (because not everyone does). My dad's family constitutes a large majority of this community because it's so huge lol. Due to the fallout between my dad and us (my sister and I), this whole community has been talking about my parents and siblings, but mainly talk about how bad my sister and I are. We have been called shameless with low characters and no morals and are blamed for why my dad stopped talking to us. Okay now, back to present day: one of the families in my community is family friends with my bf's family which leads me to what is next....

My bf's family used to go to my uncle's church and had a fallout with my uncle's family due to different Christian beliefs which turned into a screaming match after church one day. My boyfriend's dad since then has very much disliked my family and recently in the community, one of the elders (in Indian culture everyone older is referred to as uncle or aunty) somehow heard about my bf and I's relationship (I am 25, he is 27) and brought it up to his dad with his mom present (he told his mom about a year ago that he likes me and wants to marry me but did not term it as ""dating"" because in his family and this culture, it is considered wrong and sinful). His mom is a little more chill and has known for about a year now about our mutual interest in each other. When this aunty/elder came up to his dad and started talking about our relationship, my bf's mom played dumb because his dad is also emotionally abusive and controlling. He would be mad at her for knowing about our relationship and not telling him and then he would start spreading stuff about her to others. His dad has never heard about his son liking a girl and considers it a huge sin and ""distracting"" from his education and future (again, my bf is 27... this is the crazy culture we had to be born into lol). So he was shocked hearing this aunty speak about it, because she asked it in a way where it was like ""is it true?? They are talking to each other? I know your son is a good boy but that girl..."" Basically this aunty painted me to be a terrible person of low character and no morals (she used words in their language that are very derogatory). What she said is obviously untrue, but it is a result of the talk of my sister and I in our community. Everyone talks badly of us because of my dad not having a relationship with us. We are to blame because 1) we are women and 2) we are kids (25 and 26), and kids must always silence themselves and obey parents at all costs. This is what they believe, and they use the Bible to justify it (in the most twisted, unbiblical ways). So this was how my bf's dad found out about our relationship. Later when he spoke to my bf, he got mad and was very upset with him for how he could be with me, a low charactered girl who wore American work attire (they consider this to be immodest) to the Indian church one time. He even told my bf how ""white washed"" I am and the list goes on. I do not speak their language, but I understand most of it because my dad is from the same region of India as they are from. 

Okay, sorry for that LONG context but I think it is important. So now, fast forward: since August it has been very difficult because my bf is in Army basic combat training until November 2nd. He did not have an official talk with his dad before leaving saying that him and I want to be married, but he did have this conversation with his mom. His dad does knows OF me, but my bf has not gone through the official Indian process to make sure we get engaged and married (parents meeting, blessings being given, rings being exchanged, etc). My bf has family day on November 1st which is when we would get to spend time with him and then graduation day on November 2nd to watch him do his march and receive his badge as a soldier. It's a huge milestone for him and for us as a couple because we have gone through a lot together the last 5 years. I've been helping his mom prepare for both these days and have been keeping in close touch with her to encourage her and fill in the empty spot she has for him being gone. This past Sunday, he was able to call for an hour and spent a little while talking to me, then the rest of the time talking to his parents. During the call with his parents, he told them both (his dad present) that I will be coming to family day and graduation day, so he asked if we could all drive together. His mom has known and been in support of me coming for both days this entire time that her husband did not know. However, after that call, as soon as they got off the phone: apparently his dad started yelling at his mom and started telling her how dare he talk like that and tell them I am coming. He told her that it's either I go for his family day and graduation day, or they go. He was threatening her that she cannot go if I go, and that he will not go either. So my bf's mom called me yesterday evening and told me all that happened and basically told me that if I want to ""enter their family"" then I have to not go. She wants to make sure she gets to go at all costs, but expressed close to zero empathy for me not going. She also did not try even one time to advocate for me, because she wants to hide the fact that she has been knowing about our relationship from her husband. 

I'm stuck and in a dilemma. She even suggested that I tell my bf I cannot make it anymore due to work or something that came up. I told her I cannot tell him that. She sounded sort of upset/frustrated with me but basically firmly told me that I had to not go at all, or else it would be bad. Her husband threatened to call the police if he needed to if he even saw me there. I told her I am not afraid of that (because of what I went through with my dad) but she was upset and said that it would affect her. I feel bad for her, but I am conflicted. I feel really alone and upset because I cannot even talk to my bf about it. He has been depending on his mom to tell his dad about our relationship while he is at basic training, but I knew from the beginning that would not end well. It is not anyone else's job to speak to a relationship but the people in the relationship themselves. His mom is stuck in tradition and culture too and feels she has a right to control the way it plays out and how we go about getting married because she is worried about how this will affect her relationship with her husband. Her husband blames her for everything that happens to my bf and so this overall family dynamic in their house is really scaring me. My bf's dad also uses his mom to control my bf because he knows that my bf is a mama's boy and can be more easily swayed by his mom's words. I have learned a lot more about this entire dynamic the time my bf has been gone, so I suppose that's the one good thing, but I need help. What do I do?? My sister went to all lengths to stand up to my dad and this toxic culture in order to be with her now husband, and I am not seeing that from my bf's mom. I am not sure if my bf will have enough strength and confidence to do that for my sake, so I am so stuck. Please pray for me.. Any advice is much appreciated. "
2578,"I was the associate pastor for 4 years in a small conservative baptist church. I chose to leave when they hired a new executive pastor who told me ""the reason slavery is wrong now is because it's illegal"" and ""even the temptation towards homosexuality is sin.""

That, atop the growing fear and hatred of our neighbors, the practical worship of Trump, and the use of faith as an excuse for pride and cruelty, have left me burnt out.

Why should I still believe in God when he apparently lets his church drag his name theough the mud like this?

Why doesn't God do something about this ""live-in apostasty""? It seems the church has abandoned the principles of selfless love, while using Jesus as a pass for their blatant evil. 

Why do you hold onto faith when the faith is so painful?

Edit: If youre going to comment saying I was a bad pastor or just don't have enough faith, please save your fingers the efforts.  I signed up to help people, and as soon as I stood in front of the elders of the church, people I thought were my friends, I was told to sit down, shut up, and let an absolute snake lead my congregation down a path of hatred and fear.  That messed me up, and I'm doing my best to carry on. Please don't make it harder.

Edit 2: Thank you to those who have responded with compassion.  I do think I've fallen into the trap of putting my hope in the church rather than her Savior. To be fair to myself, the church I've been a part of my whole life has basically made itself out to *be* the Savior.  So when I see that church utterly failing to represent Christ, it wounds me.

I'm planning to do 2 Things.

A. Place my faith in Christ only. He still seems wonderful to me, I'm just continually confused why people who are adamant that the world follow Him do so little to follow Him themselves. 

B. Find a church that is actually living like Jesus, not resting in self-satisfaction that they are the holy ones and the people outside are the enemy. I know no church is perfect, but I've got to hope that there's a body out there that actually gets it.

I unfortunately can't respond to all of you, but thank you for the encouragements."
2579,"I made what was an honest mistake, and a lot of what I have done has not necessarily been intentional but mistakes. I’m having really bad anxiety tonight over a mistake I made… it luckily did not hurt anyone and it only hurt me emotionally…. That mistake that I made about a month ago is what made me find God.

I’m worried I just can’t be forgiven.

This is mostly just getting this off my chest but has anyone else ever felt this way?"
2581,If not then why did that happen?
2582,"My brother died and my independence with him

Let me preface this by saying, I miss my brother desperately and his loss has been the greatest suffering I have ever experienced. To lose a sibling or a child is something no one should ever have to experience but we can’t focus on what should and shouldn’t be. At some point we have to except what is. My brother is gone.

I lost my older brother in 2020 unexpectedly. His loss has put my family and more so my parents on this trajectory of fear. They are consumed by it. My parents are terrified of losing another child. I understand their pain. O boy do I. And I have spent the last 3 years holding back and being extremely considerate because I know their fear. I come home from college almost every other weekend because I know they need me, to know that I’m okay. My dads mental health is at an all time low. He battles with extreme depression and anxiety and has been manic on several occasions. My mom doesn’t think so but she equally battling with mental health in the forms of crippling fear and she’s extremely sensitive and defensive about anything. I know their pain and I have sacrificed many things because of that. But now I’m looking at the opportunity to study abroad for a semester. This coming spring. It’s something that’s been last minute and it’s my one chance to go so there has been no mental preparation for it. I’ve always talked about going in later years and anytime the conversation came up my mom would get extremely anxious and it would turn into a argument. I just don’t know what to do. This could be an amazing experience and would be great for my career. I’ve dreamed of going since I was a child. And now it’s right on the tip of my fingers. My sister has said “I want you to go…but I honestly don’t know if they could mentally handle you going, especially this soon”.

So essentially the thing stopping me from going abroad is not known if my parents grief and mental health can handle it. And as much as I try to be understanding, it’s been 3 years. I miss him too. But I can’t stop my life forever. At some point I have got to decide that I am going to keep living and moving forward not in spite of his loss but because of it. Because that’s what he would want. And I have decided on that for awhile now. But my care for my parents limits me doing so to the full extent.

So I guess I’m asking for advice. Am I being a bad daughter by wanting to go/should I stay"
2583,"I'm a young teen, I don't want to say my exact age but it's at the point where lots of other teens are starting having intercourse and im trying my best to overcome lust. I've been doing pretty well so far but the question I have is, is it worth waiting for sex until marriage? I would love to wait but I can't stop thinking about how not every tommorow is guaranteed so what if you don't live long enough to experience it. I just don't want to miss out on anything in my life you know."
2585,"I'm 16, and my parents are atheists (but accepting of any religion I choose) my aunt though, who is very involved in my life, is anti-religion. After being atheist all my life, I've found god and really want to start my journey as a christian. I feel like my soul has been saved I am so excited to be faithful to god. Yesterday, I put a bible verse in my instagram bio, and my aunt texted me freaking out about it. I didn't let her know that I actually am starting to become a christian, but she went off on how religion is the root of lots of evil and today sent me a book in the mail about why religion is terrible. I feel so bad and don't know what to do. Does anybody have advice about what to do moving forward? If I continue expressing faith I will be met with more and more backlash from that side of my family, and I'm so scared I'm going to break the strong relationships I have. 

-Thank you to everybody who’s left me advice i can’t reply to everything but i really appreciate it"
2586,"Edit: I posted this same question in r/AskAChristian and had a much more productive discussion for those of you interested. 
Link to post: https://reddit.com/r/AskAChristian/s/wUH3GxHiZm

‐--------------------------------

Hello all, I have a few questions about how Christians reconcile original sin with evolution. It seems to raise a few problems even for those with a non-literal interpretation of Genesis, as original sin is still a core Christian concept throughout the Bible. As indicated in numerous verses, is it not the basis for Jesus's mission to save us from our sins, stemming from Adam's original sin? 
(Supporting verses NRSV):
[Romans 5:12-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A12-21&version=NRSVUE), [1 Corinthians 15:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2015%3A22&version=NRSVU[E), [Psalm 51:5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2051%3A5&version=NRSVUE)

A problem then arises because evolution necessitates that suffering and ""sin"" existed for millions of years before humans. Not to mention the fact that there's good evidence our pre-Homo sapien ancestors showed signs of culture, higher intelligence, and complex social interactions (and, presumably, levels of consciousness akin to our own). So, millions of these beings suffered under and committed themselves what we'd call sinful acts (murder, r*pe, violence, etc.). If sin and suffering have always existed long before humanity evolved, how do you justify God punishing his creation by putting us in a pre-fallen world?

Some argue that God created us with free will, and that's why we sin. However, the Bible is clear we're born with a predestined sinful nature, separate from free will. This raises questions about God intentionally creating us flawed and then punishing us for it. Does it make sense that a just and all-loving God would do this?
(Supporting verses NRSV):
[Isaiah 48:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2048%3A8&version=NRSVUE), [Ephesians 2:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A3&version=NRSVUE), [1 Peter 1:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter%201%3A18-19&version=NRSVUE), [Romans 5:18-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205%3A18-19&version=NRSVUE)

Moreover, God is clearly capable of creating beings with free will that are devoid of sinful nature. The angels in heaven are like this; they can choose to sin with their free will, but sin is not inevitable for them like it is for us. If one believes that humans are created with this same nature, then why does the bible indicate otherwise?
(Supporting verses NRSV):
[Psalm 53:2-3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2053%3A2-3&version=NRSVUE), [Ecclesiastes 9:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes%209%3A3&version=NRSVUE), [1 John 1:8-10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%201%3A8-10&version=NRSVUE), [Romans 3:9-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%203%3A9-23&version=NRSVUE)

Genuinely curious and open to hearing different Christian perspectives on these issues :)"
2587,"Not sure if this is the correct place to post. I am a 30 year old Christian single female no kids and I need some advice. With that being said social media suggested a church and a pastor profile who looked very young on social media. I honestly thought he was attractive on his profile but had no intention of anything other than to find the right church and community for me. I added him about a couple weeks ago and he followed me back but no communication for weeks until few days ago.

Until, I had a Bible question that I was pondering about and I randomly messaged him for advice. What’s even crazier is that we are both located in the same small town of Oregon. And I think that’s why social media suggested his church and his personal account)I’m the first place. 

He kindly responded to my question and suggested I attend his church, which I am interested but I’m still looking around for other communities. Quickly, our conversations escalated and he “ accidentally “ face called me on social media. I not respond but I ended up giving him my phone number if he wanted to talk. He called me right away and we spoke for about almost 2 hours. Biblical conversations and also talking about our previous dating history ( I have no idea how that led there) 

He later suggested we meet up for coffee and how’s he’s interesting in me attending his church, but kept saying I should meet with him in person at a local tea/coffee shop 

Day 2 of texting he kept insisting I meet him at a local place. 

Now, I consider myself a beautiful woman, I have men interested in me so I’m pretty attractive. 

I guess my question is is this man interested in me romantically or just genuinely wants me to join his church ? 

He’s late thirties and single no kids."
2588,"I have lost two jobs due to layoffs in less than a year. 10/10/2022 and 09/06/2023. It's unbelievable and it makes me think God truly doesn't love or care about me and my family.  On top of the two layoffs, my mother died in June 2022, my daughter had a seizure (thankfully is okay), and my car was broken into and was nearly stolen over the summer. My mental health is on the edge of exploding. I'm getting just $320 a week in unemployment and my food stamps card won't load funds until 10/22. Why is God putting me through this? Why is He okay with the suffering that myself and others in my position have to go through? I just don't get it. I need prayers because I am starting to believe that my sinful life is causing God to look the other way and not provide blessings, which I can totally understand. Why would he give blessings to a sinner like me? I hate this world and I, quite frankly, am I ready to be off of it. No, I'm not suicidal. I'm not going to that area of thinking but truly I am ready to go if the Lord is ready to take me. I am fed up with this world. I don't know what else to do. "
2589,I think nudity only clashes with the values of Christianity when people behave in a sexualized manner.   The same thing is true for people who wear clothes.

2593,"I’m F(19) and I’ve know this young man M(21) for about 2 years now. It’s all remained online. Personal background I come from a Christian family. I’ve been to church and always had a Bible on me and prayed occasionally. Just recently I’ve begun to mend a relationship with Jesus Christ. This guy who is Muslim, which I’ve know for a year since I’ve know him online. We FaceTime a lot and have grown rather close, and oddly intimate over the phone. It’s caused strain on me and anxiety. It feels wrong. He’s been very adamant to introduce me to Islam. I have read about it watched a lot of video and gotten curious for him. It all leads back to this feeling deep inside me that repels against this Allah and Muhammad prophet. The guy really likes me and I really like him as well. It’s almost become mutual love. But he’s  encouraged me to show myself intimately and at first I didn’t think too hard about what I was doing with him. But now it’s grown to be a pit in my soul. He speaks of finally meeting me and marrying me, starting a family. Funny thing is I’ve never been in a relationship and I’m still a virgin. This all feels like a black mirror episode. I feel like I have a nervous attachment to him and can never quite break up with him properly. It feels ungodly and wrong in my path. Like it’s more to be a learning lesson. I’ve been praying on it and restless to come to some conclusion or see that God takes care of it for me. Please give me advice and personal opinions. I’m too young to be stuck on an online relationship that is impure. I feel very held back and restricted by him. Thank you all.

Edit: thank you all for such great advice. I’ve been so down bad in life this is very very helpful."
2594,"I heard this when Jesus got mad at the salesman making the temple a marketplace, and would this not count as the sin of wrath?"
2595,"I was in target today picking up a handful of things when a woman stopped me in the middle of the store asking if I could help her. My first thought was I don’t work here but then I thought we’ll why not try to help so I asked what she needed help with. She then opens a piece of cardboard that says something like “ please help I have 4 kids who are cold and no money” or something like that. And she asked if I could help her buy the items in her cart. ( her English was broken) the items being a blanket, various kids clothes and maybe a couple toys. I ended up having her come with me and go up to the checkout where I just bought her whole cart (about $200) and we were both on our way. Part of me can’t help but think that she does this often and “scams” people, but at the same time she wasn’t asking flat out for money and I guess who am I to judge? Did I do the right thing?"
2597,"The progress of Bible prophecy rolls on.  People are being given a chance to be saved.    I think the devil is working as hard as possible to ruin Gods , plan.  All we need to know about salvation is in the scriptures.  I thank God I got serious and repented.  I hope God wins."
2598,"God created everyone He knows beginning and end. Bible says Hell enlarges itself daily which means somebody’s going and everyone’s not going to heaven. Though we all have a choice, at the beginning of our creation it was already set in place for our destination. Thoughts 💭"
2600,"The other thing it seems no Pastors bring up in there sermons or commentaries is (Are there any negatives that can happen to your life if you really do try and steward everything for God?)

So from my understanding gathered

“God owns everything even the Heavens & the Earth”

So if God owns everything we own nothing? And now our position is “Steward” both of all material and immaterial things the Lord has given us

That the Lord has basically “Loaned” us everything we have because it’s all his anyway?

And as stewards we are to seek the will of the owner and we are called to us “everything” God has given us to do his will?

That we entrusted and are called to help build up his kingdom (some Pastors have brought up the verses in Matthew 6:10 of the Lord’s Prayer “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”)

That we are to “seek first the Kingdom of God” above all else in everything we do every single day?”

Now what I haven’t heard any Pastors go into is the question of Is there a point or time when you “shouldn’t steward everything God has given you” because of the way our society runs on a market run economy? Within our economy at the moment most businesses seem to have to “appeal” to a wide range of an audiences and markets and I’ve been told Christianity is to controversial or will harm peoples businesses?

Is there a time when money becomes more important than stewarding all God has given you? Or when do we have to serve money and not God?

It makes me ponder the question (what if every business, company, corporation where to listen to all the sermons and commentaries on “Biblical Stewardship”) how many would turn away? How many would want to “Seek first the kingdom of God above all else?” How many would go under?

Now some companies have done this “In n Out” has literally put Bible verses on there items, Hobby Lobby has a Christian section, Zero Skateboards, Ezekiel bread has put a Bible verse on there stuff it doesn’t seem that hard to print a little verse on things right? It’s kinda absurd I can only name a few off the top of my head that I remember doing this?

Some of these companies even have said this is why they promote Christian values or try to place Bible verses on things because of “Biblical stewardship” but it’s just weird to me how not many companies actually really do this?

It just makes me wonder like are there times when we (shouldn’t stewardship everything for God?) why do no sermons or commentaries bring these questions up? This isn’t one denomination that says this by the way it seems every denomination that brings up (Biblical stewardship) always uses the word “everything”?"
2601,"There’s this character in my book named Thomas Amelio, who believe in the Christian god. He is stopped by a manic psycho on a woodland trail and held hostage for conversation. After presenting the means of killing Thomas and threatening to do so twice now, the psycho notices Thomas crucifix chain, and asks “do you fear god?” 
Thomas says “Yes.”
And the psycho asks “Why?”
I need a genuine response, preferably by someone who believes in the Christian God. The prompt is how you would respond to this situation and this question if you were Thomas. The only relevant backstory I have for this character is that his mother was a heavy smoker and developed lung cancer, but two years prior to this situation, the cancer “miraculously” went into remission. Please use this detail in your response. No hate, no arguing, I just was a real response from a human being."
2604,"Hello everyone, 

I’m using a throwaway account since my spouse is also on Reddit. As the title suggests, I am looking for answers about attending a different church than my husband.

I have been married to my husband for close to ten years now. We has recently been attending a church and he really loves it. I ,on the other hand, have really been struggling to attend. The church is very conservative and a lot of what they teach, I am uncomfortable with. It has gotten to the point that my mental health has plummeted, and I have never felt this way before. Honestly, it has been getting constantly worse the more we attend this church. I have vocalized to my husband about the idea of going to another church, and he states that he refuses to do so. That God placed our family at this church specifically.

To make a long story short, we have been having a difficult in our marriage due to this issue. We have sat down with the pastor of the church.He stated that since my husband wants his family to go to this church, I must submit and obey and stay. I asked if I were to attend another church than my husband, would it be a sin. He replied and said yes I would be.

So my question, am I truly in sin if I choose to attend another church? If I am in the wrong then I would love to know. I am in a hard place right now, and feel like I’m sacrificing my mental health in order to follow my husband. 

Thank you in advance for reading"
2605,"There are some gospel songs I like to listen to. However, I’m more into pop music. Is it against the Christian religious to listen to anything besides gospel?"
2606,"In my opinion, it's because he/jesus had to go through it. If I was jesus christ and see myself being nailed to the cross and i'm bleeding nonstop, i'm pretty sure he'd want others to go through that as well so that we can suffer that same way or worse than he did. If he really cared, then pain, suffering, and evilness wouldn't have existed or exist after when he died. He'd try his best to not allow a single bit of bit exist. And don't tell me it's because we have free will. That's bs and just another way of saying what I'm saying. Just in a nicer manner

It should be the devil at LEAST allowing it to make it exist, not god/jesus. As I said, if i were god, I'd get rid of it asap. You can have free will, just do good things. Why can't you have a heaven on earth? Why does heavens setting and environment have to exist after we die and why do we have to prove ourselves or commit to jesus to experience that?"

I had dream I was pregnant witha little girl. In the dream I saw myself pregnant, i lost some weigh, and my hair had grown out. In the dream i remember wondering how my baby would look like. I remember day dreaming in the dream of my baby have dark black curly hair and tanish skin tone. For context my boyfriend (now ex)  and I are long distance and we planned to meet next summer. So I am not sexually active. I remember seeing the back of the baby but I never saw her face. I knew in the dream I was between 7 to 8 months pregnant and the baby was a girl. I remember facetiming my boyfriend in the dream and him be super happy. But I don't know what the dream means. We are not sexually active due to long distance but I knew the gender of the baby and I saw him. Also to add, me and my boyfriend is ""broken up"" right now due to family issues. However, we always have gotten back together. To include, I went for prayer almost a week ago in regards to my relationship with my (ex) boyfriend. I know when I went for prayer the man praying over me asked God to give him and I a dream and give us guidance. Because I am Apostolic Christian and he is Muslim. I don't know why I got the dream. So I was wondering if someone could explain? If someone could give me guidance? I want to keep a dream as a dream until God says otherwise but I can't stop thinking about it and it's been 3 days."

Hello friends, I have a question for you all. I’m not one to typically come forth and ask for help as I’m aware everyone’s experience is subjective but I figured perspective is always helpful.. 

I rediscovered my journey and relationship with God a little over half a year so I’m still working on letting go of control fully and trusting that all is already settled and the path paved for me by Him. 

I’m going to sum up my doubts into a couple of questions with a bit of backstory to each rather than going in depth; should you need any additional details in order to answer feel free to ask in the comments :)

1. Would God use a person to awaken me to my relationship with Him just to take the person away after?
- are we meant to be *with* the person that reintroduces us to our walk with God? can they be just a friend? if we started a relationship but it doesn’t feel right do we end it even though it’s based in Christ? 

2. Would God use a person to help me break so I can heal and grow? Would he use someone so similar to help me see my flaws? 
- we are so similar it’s ridiculous, from astrological charts, to personality type, to human design it is all the same. certainly has helped me see things in myself through him I thought I had healed

3. Would God show you your other half and allow you to be together for a bit even though you aren’t meant to? 
- I am so hurt because it feels as if I were made from his rib, we are the same exact person. but that’s also the reason we are having difficulties, both of us have things to work on and heal. but if the timing was wrong and it wasn’t him, how can I live knowing he exists and I may never find love that’s deep as such again? 

4. I have a dilemma in belief between “right person, right time” and “right person, wrong time” - according to scripture isn’t the timing always perfect? 
- it’s quite difficult for me to grasp this concept as truth because if the timing is always right then people we don’t align with must be wrong for us. does He bring people back around if the time is right?

5. Is it possible for two people to be taken apart so that they could grow and come back together better? 
- this sort of loops back to the right/wrong time I suppose. Is it that we are meant to grow individually and be better for each other or we outgrow each other and are better for our future significant other…"
2619,"Pain, suffering, death, disease, emotional pain, but that should not prevent us from having to see and look on to until the end with our faith, after all, like the bible says, there is none of that in heaven, and jesus/god has made a mansion for each of us there when we get there, I think that is amazing and sounds very comforting which is what it implies, we just, have to look on to the next day and so on until God tells us when our time is up."
2620,Can women have the calling to be pastors or no? Give me your opinion. Currently I’m Protestant and there are several women who are pastors.
2621,"I was on the way to lunch with my cousin, it was raining hard. I thought there’s not going to be parking and how I would have to park a block away and walk to the restaurant in the rain and dreaded it.

My Bible app pops up with its daily verse on my drive to the restaurant, it was John 1:51, when it lit up, it didn’t show the whole verse on the screen just the beginning (I have to unlock the phone to see the whole verse):

“Truly, truly, you will see heaven open…”

Right afterwards, the clouds almost instantly parted and there was a rainbow just seconds ago it was pouring rain.

I thought that was nice timing, but then I was running late so it didn’t go to my heart, at least I don’t have to walk in pouring rain I thought.

Just as I got to the restaurant, my cousin arrives at the door with me and we both open the 2 double doors to the place and I realized it was the wrong place and I said “oh wait this is panera” (and thought how did we both get to the wrong place?)

Just as this happens with both of us still holding open the door to the wrong restaurant, a server carrying trays and drinks on both hands walks out and thanks us emphatically because she couldn’t have opened the door herself, it would have been a difficult feat.

My cousin says, “this is why we are here”.

I look at my phone to see the time, and it’s 1:51!

Then I realized heaven opening was us opening the door for the server!

Is this a sign?"
2622,"I have a crush on a visibly atheist, logic/facts science guy, and he isn't making any signs of change.

Would appreciate if others prayed for him too."
2623,"

Personally, I believe owning/ using sex dolls is not a sin. It’s not lusting against another human, or animal, rather an inanimate object. We are human, and we crave sex. That’s obvious. Some of us cannot become intimate with partners, whether that is because of: social anxiety, anxiety, past sexual violence traumas, intimacy issues, depression, not being able to be there for someone financially because of money or emotionally because of mental illness/ trauma or physically because of work or careers. This makes sex dolls a coping mechanism for loneliness and sexual frustration.

What do you guys think? 
This is just about dolls, not involving porn or lust towards another human."
2625,"Christianity has no flaws, and sure people from an outside perspective may think it has flaws, but they do not know how it truly feels to actually be a Christian, to experience and live your life day to day for jesus/god, it is amazing, and he will give you what you want if you ask, and believe it to be already recieved, and it shall be yours, like when I prayed once before to get out of juvy considering I was a teenager and I still am but that was 2-3 months ago, I prayed to God that i get out, and he/jesus spoke to me and said ""you shall leave this place at a cost"" and I asked ""at what cost"" and he said ""you shall know soon enough"" and I said to him in my mind and praying ""ok lord, I shall believe I have already been given this gift from you my lord"" and then I said amen and after that exact prayer, i got out, I was so excited and told people about how my prayer was answered, and preached about never doing anything stupid to get you in juvy and I will so on and even now, God works in mysterious ways, but it is in all good ways, like I have heard before, someone said that God is so holy that he cannot stand to be in the presence of any sin, and I agree with that statement, but that is why we have jesus to cover for us, all of us, but not all will enter the kingdom of heaven, cause not everyone will believe, but I believe, I have belief and hope in what jesus will do for me and you and all of the other people on the planet, I trust him with my life, and I shall believe him until the very end when I die, and even so on I will continue to believe in him in the after life."
2626,"Recently, I've came across many social media pages of people being 'militant christians' or 'soldiers of Christ'.

These pages have thousands of followers, and post traditional, western aesthetics.

But they seem so...aggressive? Not in a good way, where its just passion for the faith. But in a way that screams ""I'm right, you're wrong. Fear me.""

Does Christ want soldiers?"
2627,"How do you feel about funding the Israeli government and the Israeli people? Christian Evangelism has grown to sponsor Israel in many ways and i was curious if this is something commanded to us by God to embark on. I know there are verses people point to and say we should act on, but the opposing crowd would call into question if this is the same people group referenced in the old testament.

In all, I am curious if Christians have been misguided in supporting this group or if Christians are in fact support the correct group by standing with Israel."

2629,"So, I've been thinking about posting on TikTok for a while. As a Christian, I'm not allowed to steal. However, I've noticed many accounts taking pictures from Pinterest, Google, videos from YouTube, Instagram, and other websites/apps. Now, I don't think they've asked for permission for each video, and I was considering posting some edits on TikTok. Is it considered stealing if I use someone's video without permission and use it for an edit? I've seen many people do it, and I don't think the owner of the videos I want to take minds, because as I said, many people take his videos, but I just want to be sure if it's okay or not."
2630,"I feel like most on this forum will say ""yes"". But the question runs deeper. What is a pastor? Is it someone who simply delivers a homily on Sunday morning? Someone who teaches and exegetes Scripture? Someone who shepherds and leads the flock? Personally, I think it's all of these and more.

So the issue of women being pastors becomes one of ""can women lead?"" So this is my real question to you all. Can women be good at any or all of the following:

- be a CEO of a company

- run a country

- lead men in their Spiritual walk

- administer discipline to their children

I realize this is a rather random selection of tasks. But I hang out with a number of complementarians, who believe that Biblically, the women's role is in the home, to be an assistant, not to teach but to be taught. Everyone has an anecdote: ""My mom was the Spiritual leader in our house growing up, and it just didn't turn out well. I wish my dad had stepped up into his role as father."" ""This just shows how God knows best, and how we need to step into the roles God has set out for men and women."" ""Women are too emotional to lead a company. This is why we need a man and his stoic wisdom who doesn't succumb to his fleeting emotions in leading society.""

So we all know women who effectively lead companies and countries, women who lead churches, women who are more spiritually mature and knowledgeable that their husbands. My real question, is there any real data or studies that show women can lead as effectively (or more effectively) than men? Or do their emotions just get in the way? I don't want anecdotes, because my complementarian friends will just counter with their own anecdotes. I want actual data. Any thoughts?"

2639,"I have recently decided to join the faith again. I was raised Catholic but i stopped believing and started doing some bad stuff. When I say bad stuff I mean bad like I did witchcraft, tarot cards and things like that I infested my house with negativity my house was actually haunted 😭. Then I found out i was gay ig? So I fell into a depression and was stuck deep in sexual sin. It was like that for years until something in me changed. I just felt conviction I guess? At that point I didn’t feel it at all until then. After that feeling I stopped everything because I felt like what I was doing was wrong. I felt lost and confused but eventually I got the strong urge to start praying so I did and I found my way back to Christ I stopped witchcraft and that stuff and with the gay I no longer call myself that or associate myself with that. I completely put it away for my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But of course I struggle with lust like everyone else but I make sure to rebuke all thoughts of homosexuality. I think this proves that no matter what you can turn back to Christ being whatever gay, liar, cheater, blasphemer it doesn’t matter Christ will forgive you like he did with me he will help you!  I thank God I found my way back to the faith, the faith got rid of my depression I have never been happier. I am extremely happy and excited to rebuild my relationship with Christ!😊"

2648,"One of my father's friends always tells me she prays for me often. She is not a Christian, she believes in her own personal god. Some female entity that appeared in a dream. 

I am christian and I am making a conscious and spiritual effort to further my relationship with Christ and Yahweh. 

She views her god as good, helpful and her creator.

However, I believe that anything trying to lead someone from the one true God (imo) is not good, and is from the devil. I really don't want that entities help. 

Should I ask her not to pray for me? I know she is good, just led astray. She is not asking to harm me but asking for guidance, peace and serenity for me, but just from the wrong place."
2649,"In some of the shortest parables, Jesus delivers the deepest of messages regarding faith and meaning to believers and seekers. Take for instance the parable of the Merchant and the Pearl, where in two sentences Jesus explains the priceless reward we receive through him. The Merchant, having found this one Pearl, sells all that he owns to have it because nothing else, nothing in this world, even comes close to the value of it.

The Pearl is like what many of the Saints find when they realize the reward and consolation that Jesus grants us through his death and resurrection. Augustine said, “Our hearts are restless until they rest in thee.” Thomas Aquinas said, “God alone satisfies.” Teresa of Avila said, “God alone is enough.” Repeatedly, we see this peace settle onto those with faith. They undergo drastic change by their belief in God. This is not the superficial change that comes from other pursuits, like money or vanity. This is true change.

With faith comes a gift of joy, but the world wants to suppress it and smother it. If faith isn’t giving me joy, then I’m not understanding it correctly. Those that profess their peace in Christ will have their joy tested daily, because just as his life and teachings threatened the Roman order, so does it threaten the modern empire of the Self. Those who worship the self find Christian faith childish and openly laugh at it. I certainly did. I mocked the faithful while I was fallen away from belief. But Christians can celebrate being mocked. It is perfectly fine to be laughed at, and almost an achievement in itself. Jesus prepared me for these moments:

“You will be hated by all because of my name. But the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.” Mk 13:13

I should not be deterred by this, for I do not need others approval; the only approval I should consider is God’s. So I must return daily to my faith, like a child. If I recall how I lost my faith in the first place, it was because I grew cynical in adolescence and early adulthood. I thought there were no more mysteries in life, and no God except the Watchmaker kind. But having regained my faith, I don’t want to lose it again. What I realize now is that my faith as a child made more logical sense than my doubt in adulthood.

“Amen, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” Mt 18-19

Thus when people smirk at these words, or openly jeer belief, this is actually a time to be glad. That alone is a clear indication that I am oriented in the right direction, toward God. To endure whatever comes, be it mockery, condescension, indifference, opposition, or even violence - can I remain humble and peaceful? Keeping the faith, like a child, is the correct path. The reward of eternal life through Jesus’ death and resurrection cancels any earthly insult. Nothing else on offer in this world can fulfill my heart and soul in the same manner.

I have already tried all of the other options. They all disappoint in the end. They come up short. Why?

Because they are not God, which is what I was really hungering for.

I don’t put myself into the Gospel scenes enough. I need to feel the emotion of Christ in the words. I don’t put myself into the scene of his Passion, but I need to start doing it more. How would I act in those trials and struggles? Would I fold up like a chair and crumble? Can I hear the people around me? Do I sense the tension, struggle, and pain in the words and actions? Would I even be among the crowd around Jesus, or shaking my head at them? I bet I would be, because the Romans and Jews and people of all nations who gathered to crucify him were the same as us today, they just happened to live before us.

I often find confusion in the readings. I used to give up and assume it was primitive fairy tales, but now I know I must speak to wiser believers about it, or read the writings of the early Church. Every rebuttal and question that I can think of has already been asked, pondered, argued, even fought over. Ask, seek, knock: if I shutter my mind when I come up against something difficult, then I have despaired and turned away. When I’m confused, this is precisely the time to discuss the words with other members of the faith. Find real people to talk to about it, and avoid online comment pits of conversation on social media. There is little or nothing to learn on social media. I must speak with people of faith, as “iron sharpens iron.” Far wiser people than I have gone over these words and remained solid in their belief.

Jesus and his teachings are what my soul wants. I am the Merchant and Jesus is the Pearl. If I return to my treasure daily, as the Saints did, and read deeply, and yearn for the spirit of Christ, he will guide my day, and ultimately my life.

2657,"At the begining of this year I decided to reread the Bible, got a nice study Bible and downloaded a random reading plan. This particular one splits the days by topic. If you have any thoughts or insights I'm happy to listen and learn. I can be snarky at times but I hope to never be disrespectful. I'm going to do it again in 2024 so if you want to hop on the bus then I'll get back to where you started from. So on this reading plan it's History Tuesday which is always interesting.

So at this point the twelve tribes are divided, Rehoboam rules from Jerusalem and he's got the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Jeroboam rules the land of Israel from Shechem with the other ten tribes. To be honest, I'm not sure which one I would support, both Kings are kind of awful.

Rehoboam of course gets back to Jerusalem and wants to start a war against Israel. God has a word with Shemaiah, telling him to tell Rehoboam not to fight against your fellow Israelites. The soldiers all go back home, it doesn't say how Rehoboam felt about it but I'm imagining him as a bit annoyed. So Rehoboam builds up his defences, he's sure there's going to be a war at some point. The Levites defect over to his side too because Jeroboam's being awful. Rehoboam has 18 wives and 60 concubines and has 88 children because adultery is bad guys.

There's a bit of assumptions I've got to make here, Jeroboam appointing his own priests and supplanting the traditional role of the Levites seems to have happened really early on. 1 Chr 11:17 say that the Levites supported Rehoboam for three years. 1 Chr 12:1 says that after Rehoboam was established he and the land abandoned the law of the Lord and so Shishak attacked in Rehoboam's fifth year. I can't imagine that the Levites would have been okay with Rehoboam abandoning God so they must have stopped supporting him just before Shishak's attack. Is that right? Or would the Levites have been fine with still supporting Rehoboam?

Anyway, all the planning Rehoboam was doing against an attack from the north didn't help when Shishak the king of Egypt attacked. Egypt had 1,200 chariot, 60,000 horsemen and innumerable infantry and without God's help Rehoboam is in a very bad place. God sends Shemaiah in again to basically tell Rehoboam that he's on his own and Rehoboam humbles himself before God. God gives in a bit and allows Rehoboam to remain king which he does for another 12 years. 1 Chr 12:8 says that Judah would be subject to Egypt's king but that plot thread doesn't really go anywhere and it's not mentioned that Egypt has any authority over Judah.

There's some fighting between Judah and Israel and Rehoboam's son with his favourite wife succeeds him, that's King Abijah. Abijah started his reign like his father did, gathering up 400,000 men to fight Jeroboam's 800,000. Seems like a bad idea. But unlike his father, Abijah had God on his side (it now says that the Levites are back to supporting Judah) and routed Jeroboam's forces. Jeroboam died and Abijah had 14 wives and 38 children because adultery is bad guys. But he only reigned for three years, followed by Asa. Asa seems to have been devout, he had ten years of peace and even then when the Cushites attacked he defeated them with God's help.

The NIV gets really confusing because sometimes it talks about Judah as Israel and sometimes Israel means not-Judah, ie the Northern Kingdom formerly ruled by Jeroboam.  It looks like despite Abijah's victory, he didn't conquer the whole of Israel. He took the lands of Ephraim (the hill country north of Jerusalem) and lots of people from Ephraim, Manasseh and Simeon came and settled in the lands of Judah and Benjamin.

Theologically it's not very deep, it seems like the Bible's just saying look when you obey God things go well and if you don't obey God then the King of Egypt comes along and steals your stuff.

1 Chr 15:19 sets up a perfect cliffhanger, ""There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign."" But what war will that be? I'll have to wait until next Tuesday.

Tomorrow is Psalms Wednesday and I'll be reading Psalms 117 and 118."

2661,"Hello everyone, I (22F) have recently entered the workforce in the United States and I have made it my plan to tithe 10%. Since I don't currently have a home church (having moved across the country), I am tithing to my campus ministry that supported me for four years in college. I plan to save the rest of the ten percent to give a large amount when I decide on a home church in my new city. BUT I am really struggling with continuing tithing because now that I see how expensive things are I am not able to live the life I thought I would after college. I struggle with comparing myself to my brothers who do not tithe at all and who have way more in savings/retirement than I do and are able to buy new cars/pay off student loans faster. It is just so hard when my family/friends say ""you have so much money, this shouldn't be a problem"" or ""stop stressing about money, you should have plenty"" but at the end of the day I don't have the cash to be doing $300 weekends like the rest of my friends/family cause I tithe $400 a month. I have student loans as well and my car is an old 2002 which I really want to update. I look at my income and I am very blessed because I can pay my bills, tithe, and make decent student loan payments each month but I can't shake the thought that my income could go way further if I weren't tithing. For instance, I could have my student loans paid off by March next year instead of July next year. I also do not have an emergency fund or any other savings which is a little scary for me as I have been learning the importance of these in the financial world. I guess I just want to know if anyone else has been in this situation and can empathize and encourage me to continue tithing because I know it is important. "
2662,"Prayer based on Romans 4:13-25

Good works done in our own strength will not save us.

Father, thank You for teaching us salvation by faith alone through Abraham. You counted Abraham as righteous not because of his works but because he believed in You. Open our minds and hearts, so that we may receive this truth and rejoice more and more in Your salvation.
You tell us, the promise to Abraham did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith. Your law demanded obedience and performance, impossible for us to do in our own strength. Your law brings wrath, but where there is no law, there is no transgression. So it was for Abraham. The promise given to Abraham transpired 430 years before Moses received the law for the Jews. Thank You for providing the righteousness that You require through Your Son to all who believe. You give life to the dead and calls into existence the things that are not, as though they were! You declare Your children righteous, not because of any works they had done but because they believe. Abraham believed against all hope that he would become the father of many nations, even though he was very old and his wife was barren for ninety years. Because Abraham believed in Your promise, he was counted righteous. The same is true for everyone who believes in the sinless life of Jesus, His death, and His resurrection.
Father, may we never trust in any work we have done but believe that Your Sons finished work alone is sufficient for our salvation. Amen. (Mathew 5:20)
One wise man once said that an ounce of Faith gives more glory to God than a ton of works.
Questions for reflection and meditation:
1.	What good work can you trust in for salvation?
2.	Do you believe and rejoice in the truth of (Romans 8:16-17)?
3.	Scripture tell us that we are saved, by faith alone apart from works then how can God rightly judge us by our work? (Revelation 20:12, Psalm 62:12, 1 Peter 1:17)
4.	What circumstances in your life have made it difficult for you to believe in the promises of God?
5.	What did Abraham do that caused him to grow strong in his faith. (verse 20)
6.	What does it take for someone to be counted as righteous? (Verse 24-25)"
2664,"Is water baptism a requirement for salvation in your opinion? Or is baptism by the holy spirit the correct answer?

From my understanding to add things like water baptism, good works and the like, for our salvation requirement, all take away from God's gift of grace through Christ's death.

Who on earth is righteous enough to give me salvation if not God himself? Isn't the spirit of God enough for me to be baptized?"

>**Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, 'Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?' Jesus answered, 'I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.'（Matthew 18:22）**

As it is said in the scriptures, we must learn to forgive others. However, in everyday life, I sometimes argue with my husband, and I also experience jealousy towards my colleagues. Moreover, I find some people truly annoying. These issues trouble me greatly. I feel that these feelings of anger and jealousy well up from deep within, and I find it challenging to control them. Even though I may pretend that everything is fine, God knows what I truly feel in my heart. Certain verses from the Bible have always been in my mind, such as Hebrews 12:14, which says: ""Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness, no one will see the Lord.""

>**Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.**  
**Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.（Matthew 23:27-28 ）**

2671,"Paul, the author of several letters that are part of the New Testament, requests the manumission of a slave named Onesimus in his letter to Philemon, writing ""Perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back forever—no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a dear brother"" (Philemon 15-16). In addition, the Book of Revelation condemns the slave trade on the basis that it involves the marketing of human souls and their bodies as if they were cargo. The views that Paul and Revelation had are not the only ones in ancient Judaism to oppose slavery. The Essenes, a radical Jewish sect in Israel which rejected much of the institutions of civilization, also rejected slavery, for violating the free equality of man. 

In the fourth century, the bishop Gregory of Nyssa articulated a fundamentally Christian conception of the world that embedded a thorough rejection of the notion that one human could be owned by another and a condemnation of the institution of slavery.

Part of the New Atheist attack on religion, it also comes from various progressive circles in order to defend certain social views.

When we read verses like Ephesians 6:5, Colossians 3:22, and 1 Peter 2:18, we hear the common English translation “slave” in light of our own historical context. We typically think of race-based, chattel slavery in which the slave is the property of the master and lacks any legal rights. This kind of slavery is manifestly among the most despicable institutions ever to disgrace human civilization. It is not, however, what is in view in these texts.

The Greek word (doulos) can be translated “slave,” or sometimes “servant” or “bondservant,” and often referred to people who had a surprising level of legal and social status in the first-century Greco-Roman world. Most were not “slaves” from their birth, or for their whole life, or because of their race—for instance, the Roman jurist Gaius (second century) claimed that most slaves were prisoners of war who actually would have been slaughtered if not made slaves.

Similarly, in the Old Testament, Israelite regulations freed slaves every seventh year (Ex. 21:2), commanded the death penalty for manstealing (Ex. 21:16), and generally sought to limit the institution in protection of the slave. Further, slavery was generally not organized by race but by circumstance and economics (for example, foreigners, debtors, and so on).

Progressive revelation simply means that God didn’t reveal his will and character to humanity all at once, but gradually over a long period of time. Thus, you have to look at the entire narrative of biblical revelation to interpret it fairly, rather than just pull a verse from here or there.

Christians also believe God accommodates his revelation to particular historical contexts, and even to fallen social structures within them. This makes sense when you think about it—unless we require that God refrain from giving any instructions or laws to a particular people at a particular time until all societal evil has been removed. An ethical exhortation in an ad hoc document (like an epistle), then, may not tell you everything you need to know about God’s will and character. 

Similarly, practices like slavery, polygamy, and divorce were common in antiquity. Biblical instruction that allows for them in certain contexts isn’t necessarily biblical approval. We must interpret them in relation to everything else the Scriptures say.

Biblical instruction that allows for [certain evil practices] in certain contexts isn’t necessarily biblical approval.

Someone might say, “Okay, even if we grant that we’re dealing in most cases with a less egregious form of slavery, and that perhaps God is accommodating his revelation within a historical context—still, why doesn’t the Bible say more against slavery?”

I sympathize with this concern. However, one final consideration has helped me think about this over the last few years, and deepened my conviction that the Bible as a whole is utterly opposed to any form of slavery: Philemon.

It is surprising that Philemon is not brought into this discussion more consistently, since it was Paul’s letter to a slaver owner (Philemon) about his runaway slave (Onesimus). In fact, the whole occasion for Paul’s writing is that Onesimus, since running away from Philemon, has become a Christian.

If Scripture were truly pro-slavery, what would you expect Paul to say here?

Strikingly, Paul instructs Philemon to receive Onesimus “no longer as a slave . . . but as a dear brother”—and he appeals to Philemon to “receive him as you would receive me”

In other words, Paul dissolves the slave/master relationship, and erects in its place a brother/brother relationship, in which the former slave is treated with all the dignity with which the apostle himself would be treated. Thus, even before the actual institution of slavery is abolished, the work of the gospel abolishes the assumptions and prejudices that make slavery possible.

2672,What are the quality’s that Christians should have or at least strive to have
2674,"So one of the Ten Commandments is “Thou Shalt Not Kill/Murder”, and Jesus himself wasn’t too fond of war and violence.


With this in mind, is it permissible for a Christian to serve in the military and/or fight in a war? I’ve heard some say it’s fine as long as you’re fighting to protect others and/or stop someone/something bad from happening. I also know that some sects such as Quakers, Mennonites, and the like are extremely pacifistic and oppose war in any circumstances. 


Being in the military doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll see combat, but it’s definitely a possibility.


Thoughts? What’s the Christian/Biblical take on this?"

About a year ago I met a guy around my age (about a 9 1/2 month gap) and he is 14. We are both Christians and we both are from the same church, and he does lots of volunteer work and he does more good than harm to my spirit, and he’s very nice and we share the same morals and beliefs. I am 80 percent sure he likes me and I really really like him. My parents think he is a good kid, although they don’t know he is my love interest. If we were to start dating we wouldn’t do anything bad like pre-marital sex/lust and all of that stuff. I feel like I want to confess my love but I know that is against my parents will and I want to respect them and not do that. What do I do? How do I know when I am ready to date?

A related question that almost always gets asked as a follow up is, “Why is it a sin if it doesn’t harm anybody?” I have done my best to give Biblical answers to this question multiple times, but my posts consistently get removed by the mods. I find this question to be relevant to the Christian life and always on topic, but I don’t know how to discuss it in a way that doesn’t break the rules.

It then turned day, and then night, and then day again. For some reason I associated this as a sign of the coming of Jesus, no idea why. The second part of the dream was me preaching to a small crowd of people, none of them would understand my words. After some time I just gave up and told them “You’ll see”. Does anyone have any idea whatever that dream meant?"
2683,"I am 17 and asexual. A few months ago when I was 16, I was raped multiple times by my ex-boyfriend over the course of 2 months. It’s left me scarred and traumatized, but I am seeking help through therapy currently. 

It is another night where I cannot sleep because I remember the touch of his hands on my body. I feel disgusting, and feeling that I would never be pure again.

I wanted to have no sex before marriage. I feel sad it was taken away from me by force. Will I ever be pure? Can I still be pure? I know purity and virginity are social constructs, but I can’t help not feel shitty over it, when marriage has been something I looked forward to for many years now.

I want to elope with my current boyfriend a few years from now. We are both from bad family backgrounds that involve abuse. We don’t want our families to know we are getting married so young. They would never approve.

I wish I could have saved myself for him. I really hate myself, and I blame myself for being so naïve constantly.

I’m sorry this is heavy and all over the place. English is not my first language. I am feeling a lot of emotions right now. He’s long gone from my life, but the memory of him still lingers. I want to cry. I feel gross."

2685,"Prayer is essential in the Christian faith because it is a way to communicate with God. In the Bible, Jesus often prayed to his Father in heaven, and he taught his disciples how to pray. Prayer allows Christians to express their gratitude to God, ask for forgiveness, seek guidance, and make their requests known to Him. Through prayer, Christians can deepen their relationship with God and experience His love and peace."

I have been looking for work but struggling often with being able to afford groceries and other basic necessities as well as transportation to get to interviews. I am incredibly stressed and overwhelmed. I have been praying constantly and using my faith because I believe God can do the impossible and help me more than I could have imagined. Please pray for me because I need urgent help, I am still looking for work but not being able to afford even groceries is taking a toll on me because one can only take so much, I need groceries today. I would like some weight off my shoulders because it is all getting too much for me. I trust God to make a way for me because His word does not lie, He said in Isaiah 41:13 that He will hold our right hands saying to us to not fear and that He will helps us.

I know that in the future, I'm going to want to install Reddit again because I'm going to need help, advice, etc. I don't know why I like porn. If it isn't Reddit, it's the Incognito Tab from Chrome, if it isn't that, it's my mind. I REALLY don't feel good though, it's like I'm speechless or I can't grasp what I did. 

I've removed Reddit more than once because I wanted to stop but I can't resist it. I don't understand why God hasn't hardened my heart, I keep repeating it over and over again. I don't want to tell Him what to do but He shouldn't help me if I continue to make the same mistake."

When you deny scripture you are literally denying Jesus Christ

The way we can tell if someone is lying is if it is not written because God would not contradict himself. 

Why do some people pick and chose what you want to believe.

I am 18 years old and have been through problems. Depression, gender dysphoria, anxiety, sickness in my family, so I had stopped being religious at the start of my teenage years. As you might imagine, that and the sinners surrounding me made me do not great things.

I fall to lust time and time again. I have dressed as Lucifer for halloween and deeply regret it. I have abused many substances in bad ways, and I participated in pagan rituals.

I had heard, even if it wasn't clear to me before, the word of God. I'm afraid that I am not doing enough to deal with my past and many present sins. I don't know how to change my mindset easily. I go to church as much as I can, and plan on confessing my sins to a priest. What else can I do?

2694,I’m currently agnostic and asked her if I have to take everything in the Bible literally. She asked her pastor and returned this answer. They also referenced Hebrews 11:6 to support this claim. Thoughts?
2695,"I have noticed that at least 8 or 9 in every 10 posts are something along the lines of ""Is this a sin?"" or ""Why this is a sin!""

That is approaching Christianity all wrong.

Jesus came down to earth, lived among us, preached to us, and then was crucified by us so we would not have to live in fear of sin. The Bible says ""rejoice in the Lord"" and that's what we are called to do. If we always live in fear of sin that is not rejoicing in the Lord! If we cast out others because of our differences that is not rejoicing in the Lord. We are not living in the Old Testament. God sent his son down to lift the weight of sin off of our shoulders. You could be sin once a day, or sin one thousand times a day, it doesn't matter how good you are, without the love of Christ, we would all be damned. But because of Jesus we don't have to live in fear of the consequences of sin, because he washes us clean.

What I'm trying to say is that instead of living in fear of what is and what isn't sin, and judging others for their own sins, we should be rejoicing in the Lord, spreading his word, and looking forward to the great reward waiting in heaven.

Jesus says no matter what your sins are, if you repent, then you are forgiven, there is no limitations to that. Whether you are gay, a thief, a liar, an adulterer, etc, if you ask Jesus for forgiveness, he will forgive them. That's what the Christian community should be telling people.

Now am I justifying sin or am I saying sin is okay? No. I don't think sin is okay, I am merely saying that it is no longer something that we as Christians have to live in fear of because of the love of Christ, and that we should not be condemning those who do not know God, we should be spreading the word of God to them."
2696,"  

St. Gregory the Theologians saw the way Christ corrects is not through legalism or excessive words, but by his own person. The incarnation shows us the true way of purification https://www.patheos.com/blogs/henrykarlson/2023/10/st-gregory-the-theologian-and-the-incarnation/"
2697,"This is one of the most asked questions by non-believers to Christians where in the Bible is it mentioned by Jesus that He is God, Worship me in a direct way. In many verses, Jesus claims He is God  

1. John 8:58 - “Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.” 

2.  John 10:30 - I and *My* Father are one.

3. Revelation 22:13 - I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and *the* End, the First and the Last.

The Disciples worshipped Jesus Christ after seeing him walk on the water Matthew 14:33 - Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God.” And he never denied the worship which also claims his divinity. 

But why didn’t Jesus say the exact words I am God, Worship Me? I do not know but maybe Jesus didn’t reveal himself as God during his human life because it was not his time yet. If we look into Matthew 16:13-20, we can see that Peter confesses Jesus as the Christ but once he does Jesus tells him that he should say to no one that he was the Christ. If we take Matthew 17:1-11, we can see Peter, James and John seeing a vision and Jesus says to them at the end “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.” He was on Earth to glorify the Father and This might be why Jesus never directly told us He was God but indirectly proved that he is God during his human life on Earth.

2699,"I haven't yet found a Christian who can answer this question.

If the Bible's oldest passage is around 4 thousand years old, how can this relatively modern religion account for the whole of humanities' understanding of God? (Humanity has been around for approx. 300 thousand years)

John‬ ‭14:6‬ ‭NLT‬‬
[6] Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.""

How can my entire understanding of God be derived from this one religion? It hasn't existed for most of humanity whether geographically or through time.

I love Jesus but I struggle to say he is Lord and I feel that I cannot believe in my heart by my own choice.

If anyone has a good answer for my question please answer best you can.

2704,"
I'm going to be honest, I'm getting more intrigued by affirming Christianity. 

I'm not going to full out say I don't think it's a sin yet but I do think maybe I would benefit from moving into a safer sect of Christianity. At least while I am working through my ""issues"" (appeantly self harm is a bigger deal than I thought...) 

In all honesty, people also were divided on issues like women's rights and slavery regarding Christianity. And so I feel like this is just another phase of that. Again, I'm not going to say I 100% believe it but I'm not opposed now either. I'm in a state of curiosity. 

But I am curious as to if this would help my relationship with God. (Like how Anne Lister was gay and also religious. She seemed at peace with it). 

Idk. I still feel guilty for considering it but anything is better than resenting God, right? Like I truly loathe being a Christian right now because I feel like I am forced to be miserable and God hasn't done anything in return. I pray and feel nothing. I feel like he's ignoring me even though I desperately want to feel his love like everyone else says. I want a good relationship with God but its hard to do that when I feel like he doesn't want me. 

I guess right now I'm curious to just hear how people who made the change feel it affected their relationship with God."
2705," I'm currently living in a hectic world, filled with all sorts of distractions and temptations. I used to be really into social media, fashion, and entertainment, and I didn't pay much attention to religion and faith.

As I've gotten older, life has become more complicated and uncertain. There are so many social issues, environmental disasters, and relationship challenges happening all over the world, and it's left a lot of us young folks feeling lost and anxious. I've seen many of my peers struggling with anxiety, depression, and a sense of unfulfillment.

Slowly but surely, I started getting interested in faith. I decided to explore Christianity, attend church events, listen to sermons, and talk to other young people about their faith experiences. This process made me realize that faith can provide me with strength to tackle life's challenges. During my journey of faith exploration, I discovered that many young people are also becoming interested in faith and spirituality. We're seeking something different from materialism, something that can offer guidance, hope, and inner peace.

I've connected with some other Christians now, and we've organized small Bible study groups to share our understandings and insights. Do you think young people need God more now?"

Idk what came over me, but I felt like I needed to pray to Christ and beg for forgiveness for all my sins and ask for help. I didn’t know if Christ would help me but something just told me to pray.

I guess it would be kinda hard to ask Adam if he wanted to be alive, since he wasn't alive to be asked. But still.

Not sure why Adam would be lonely or God would determine that being alone is no good, because supposedly when people get into heaven or whatever all people are going to want is God. And how did Adam even know what loneliness was in the first place, if God hadn't created the emotion then handed it to Adam.

2724,"Hello! 

I am a Baha'i and I've recently been looking to read the Bible among other holy books such as the Torah and the Quran (your definition of holy may be different than mine), and I have a few questions before I get started. 

It is my understanding so far that the Bible is made up of 66 total books. Do each of these books carry the same ""significance""? Do most Christians read all 66 books? 

Perhaps answers may vary, but which Bible translation/type should I read? Are they mostly the same? Do different Christian sects/denominations use certain Bible translations? 

I also would like to know what each of you think of the idea popular among agnostics and others that claim that parts of the Bible has been altered, changed, or invented over time or perhaps lost through translation, as this is the main reason I'm wary about which Bible translation to read. 

Some of these questions may be stupid to y'all. Please bear with me as I do not know an awful lot about topics like this and it's obviously my first time on this sub. Just looking to constantly learn more and more every day.

**How much do you agree/disagree with the following statement?**.  

“The Fate of the departed is not considered decided until final judgment., Until then we cannot consider anyone finally judged; and on the basis of this we pray, Convinced of God’s immeasurable mercy”.  

1.  Agree strongly.  
2. Agree more than disagree.  
3. Disagree more than agree.  
4. Disagree strongly.  

**Bonus** do you believe that if we make our bed we have to lie in it or does praying for the dead give them a chance for salvation?"
2729,I have bin a christian for about 17 years now and I pray and read my Bible every day. Sometimes I read too much and get tired. I don't realize it until I start getting sleepy. What I wanted to ask is how much would be enough to read? Thank you for readingy post have a good night and god bless.
2730," I'm a single mother bravely navigating life's trials and tribulations. I live in a small town, and my daily routine begins with the blaring sound of the alarm clock. I head off to work to provide for my family while simultaneously ensuring that my two young children are well taken care of.

This is no small feat for me. I often find myself torn between the mounting pressures at work and the responsibilities of being a mother. Once I return home, there's no respite as I help my children with their schoolwork. Despite my best efforts, I carry a deep sense of anxiety and suffering within me.

2731,"I lived in college on my own out of state about a year, came home and moved in with my god brother for about 4 years until we fell out. I’ve been living with mom for about a year and I’m ready to live alone in solitude this time. It will be my first time living completely alone no roommate .

The rent is only $1000 I make about $3040 a month (19/hr) but it includes wifi and all utilities and not the worst neighborhood either (not perfect but there are much worse neighborhoods in my city comparatively)

Any advice or prayer appreciated , spending the next 2 months or so praying, fasting , and saving up for the big move.

2732,I know it's weird but I never heard an explanation in church or in the bible and its always wondered me.
2733,"My thoughts are so rude towards God. 

I’m not necessarily going to write what my thoughts are, but basically my mind tells me that God isn’t real, and that I’m above him.  (I DONT TRULY THINK THIS OBVIOUSLY!!!) God rescued me. 

God has done so much for me. I hate when my mind does this. I just want to be pure. 

It’s absolutely disgusting, and even when I repent and ask God to take these thoughts away, they stay. 

What can I do?"
2734,"To start, im not a biblical scholar type- so i very well could be wrong about a lot of the following

To me God does all things, theres a passage in the bible where it clearly states that God creates evil and peace just alike. God is above all and controls all manner of things

Why do so many people blame demons, satan or others if God controls all things?

Why blame demons or satan or others, when nothing they do is beyond the authority and control of God? When God has allowed all of their actions?

I know theres the free-will thing, but i remember there being a passage about people already having their names written in the book of life before their birth. So doesnt that mean that God already knew everything that would happen from the onset? That everything that has transpired has been allowed by God to do so?

My life is pretty bad and i own it, but i dont see how God couldve possibly erred in its creation or how some other force couldve interceded without permission from God to do so. Like if im going to hell or sheol, God already knew that before i was born- so what was the purpose of my life at this point? Or anyone else whos had a bad life? And dont tell me were just put in a grinder to scream for help from jesus, because God said to put none before him."
2735,"We live in a world that has a downward trend in violence compared to centuries past. It's worth exploring the concept of the ""yourney to worldwide sinlessness"" as an alternative to the traditional idea of a ""judgment day,"" as commonly found in monotheistic religions.  Murder, rape and violence,are slowly on the decline. Not in absolute numbers but in %. Here are some reasons why this perspective may be more logical:

&#x200B;

1. **Continuous self-improvement:** The concept of judgment day often implies a single, final evaluation of one's actions. In contrast, the evolution of sinless encourages individuals to engage in continuous self-reflection, the meaning of sin, bonding and allows for personal growth.
2. **Adaptation to changing neliefs:** As societal values and beliefs evolve, so does our understanding of morality and ethics. The idea of a judgment day may not address these evolving standards. Did we understand God's plan correctly from the start?
3. **Reduction in judgment:** There is evidence to suggest that society is becoming less violent compared to centuries ago, as people increasingly embrace tolerance, empathy, and understanding. An evolving judgment process aligns with the possibility of judgment not being necessary anymore.
4. **Universal applicability:** The concept of an evolving judgment process can be more inclusive, as it doesn't rely on specific religious or cultural beliefs. It can resonate with individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. A lot of sins are universally accepted as sins but might have different names.

I do believe that in the end God will be love for every person/soul ever lifted But that doesnt stop me me from thinking about reducing harm."
2737,"I'm at a loss for what to do. I've been depressed for years, but these past few months have been especially bad. For some of that time I found comfort in reading scripture and going to church. Nowadays I just feel so much pressure from the words I read.

As a Christian you're supposed to find joy and fulfillment in keeping God's commandments and avoiding sin. The more I think about my sins the more worthless I feel. As a Christian, I understand that Jesus died for our shortcomings and that through him we can be whole again. I believe this, but I don't feel any connection with God. 

I don't know if this makes any sense, I'll probably just delete this later. Why can't I feel any of the joy other people talk about?"
2738,"As a Christian, what is your say on the Alien thing that is coming around in the news these past few weeks?

Are they real? Since Sunday School we have been taught and read about how God created Adam and Eve and how we all are here today.

If they are real, what would be God's stance towards them? Do they also get eternal life?"
2739,"I’m not talking in a idolatrous, trinitarian, or oneness sense. But could it be that there’s a difference between YHWH (lord) and God? The scriptures teach God, the Father is an invisible, unapproachable spirit. Now, if you’re not into logic and physics, just stop here, I am not appealed to nonsensical illogical contradictions. According to my research and studies, God the Father is so perfect he cannot change, move, think, or act—he can only influence. Now, God the Father created the world through the Logos. He did not physically create it, but inspired the Logos to create it and man in their image. Could this physical manifestation of God the Father be YHWH which would make YHWH Jesus Christ?"
2740,"I just finished a hike through a section of the Appalachian Trail which wound through a state in the “Bible Belt” of the US. For context, hikers here are absolute zealots about leaving nothing but footprints. We carry our trash for days to dispose in the next town so leaving nothing behind is a big deal.

On this 30ish mile section I hiked last week, someone had placed Christian reading material carefully double sealed in plastic bags by the trail and defaced the hash marks used for navigation with cross symbols. The hash marks are white paint on the trees every so often used to mark the route. The cross painted on each hash mark this section and reduced the visible area of the mark. The latter is an issue for me as it made the hash marks harder to read in low light as we hiked near the end of the day. In short a safety hazard.

I always thought that the best way for Christians to recruit was through a personal touch. Reach out to a friend, help someone in need. Make it personal; bur it seems that some (well intentioned) people think this recruitment technique works? As a secular individual this is not how one would recruit me. As Christians, do you view depositing reading material, signs, etc as an effective marketing tool or are these just the bad neighbors in the community?"
2741," 

I 23 (F) am the youngest of 3 sisters, born and raised in a conservative Indian Christian household in Mumbai, and have been doing WFH for the past 2 years.

Dad was working from the Gulf during the initial years of marriage and thus Mom didn't know a lot about him like his nature, triggers, and eating habits ( this one caused too many fights >< !! ) .

Dad was brought up in poverty and had 4 other siblings. Let's just say the family dynamic was already off and here we are talking about generational trauma. my grandma (dadi) is bitter in her behaviors and only wants people for her benefit while my grandad was an alcoholic and passed away early.

Mom left taking tuition early on, as Dad said he would manage the finances and Mom needed to take care of her 3 children. Dad set up a shop in the local area and by the age of 6 me and my siblings started helping him in the shop work (computer-related, set in 2005), Till my eldest sibling joined him permanently after completing her 12th.

While I do agree dad raised us up in a better way, he was a provider in terms of materialistic, financial, and mostly all aspects except (emotional and mental well-being).

He insulted and abused Mom in front of us, called us names, gaslighted and emotionally traumatized us while expecting us to not raise our voices, concerns, or opinions of any kind. We should be grateful for the things he has done for us since he is better off than his mom and dad and clearly, we are privileged but after being 23 yrs ...for him, I am not an adult yet to make any decisions regarding money, finance investment, socializing or even taking my own decisions.

I came back to my faith only a few months ago ...coz Dad always used the religion card to make it look like we are sinners and less worthy people yet go to church, read the bible, etc., and had to do something to earn god's love ..yeah really ruined that for us.

I would like to describe our family dynamic in the following way

1. Dad - narcissist parent
2. Mom - passive onlooker/enabler
3. eldest sis - golden child /lost child
4. middle sis - black sheep/scapegoat /rebel
5. me - the golden child

Me and my middle sister are planning to leave after our eldest sister's marriage after a few months. Any advice on how we should proceed further to ensure our physical safety?

Current plan:-

to file NC, contacting women's cell for added protection on the day we leave ..but need a more specific plan and guide as to how to execute the plan with minimal damage.

PS:- he has previously threatened us about using things he has brought for us ( like a laptop or anything else ) and the fact that we are staying in his house.

 "
2742,"So for both of you, 

1) Is it required in your church to venerate saints in order to regularly attend and be considered Orthodox or is that an optional thing. 

For each of you

2) What are the actual differences in doctrine taught between Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox such as the Ethiopian tawahedo or Coptic churches?"
2743,"This is my first Reddit post ever ( yae!!!!) 

Pretty much I'm 16 f and I would like to say I'm bisexual-Asexual ( I really don't like the fact I am and I just feel bad about it ). I would like to ask mainly sisters in Christ am I weird or a mess up, because why I am attracted to how ( most ) men look, but when it comes to genitals I kinda am repulsed by how a penis looks ( I don't send but I have learned through google about both male and female anatomy ). I would like to add ( as awful as it is ) I have thought about myself having sex ( and I know God created sex for a reason, 1. for pleasure 2. to repopulate ) also I know this is weird to say, but I do like the thought of bdsm stuff ( choking,biting, anything degrading like that ). So yeah...... I just want to know if  what I'm experiencing is normal. I will try to answer as soon as I can, I'll be respectful also, thank you for your time it means alot <3"

2748,"Let just begin by saying, if anybody else here has family members that are New Age you might understand me when I say that it's harder to work around New Agers than it is to work with Atheists.

Anyways, my Mom and my Dad are both very New Agey. We're Brazilian, and in Brazil it is very common to identify with Kardecism, Spiritism or Umbanda. All of these involve beliefs in ancestral spirits, speaking to the dead, and even channeling spirits (fortunately they've never and I don't think will ever go this far). But essentially my family very innocently believes that general spirits are to be trusted. I don't understand how they can be so naive, but they are.

Now, it's a lot harder than it sounds. My mom is very sensitive, and she's gotten so much comfort from these religions, and since my grandmother passed away recently, my mom is drawing comfort from these (essentially) pagan beliefs. Now, I know my mom especially, is very sensitive like I said. And to make matters worse, I can tell she is currently battling to not fall into depression (or something mental health related). I know her well enough to know that if I just outright spilled the beans on how she's being deceived by her religions (pretty much one of her biggest sources of comfort right now), I can easily see that not necessarily leading her closer to Christ, but just falling into a pit of depression and maybe even overall general faithlesness. And also, on top of that, I don't know how well equipped she is mentally to handle some of the harsher teachings of the Bible.

&#x200B;

And I know exactly where this New Ageyness began. Well, my mom once told me that her mom and dad, got metaphorically dragged and vexed into a masonic club or something to that effect by an aunt (I know!! but my grandma and grandpa, God bless them, they were extremely GOOD people, Catholic, my grandma, but literally had no idea what they were getting dragged into, absolutely blameless in this in my honest opinion). And from what I understand they have rules on walking out. But they walked out after the second or so time. Well, basically ever since that happened, my mom (as a child), began having sleep paralysis dreams, my mom's sister would see weird stuff as well. And ever since then my mom has been trying to find explanations for her experiences, and in these religions they tell her she's a Medium and that she needs to purse this further.

I seriously don't know what to do, this is such a complex situation, and there's no one for me to talk about this, and almost no fellow Christian family members I can speak with. I don't know how to discern whether or not I should TELL them and PREACH as much as possible, or if the timing just isn't right yet. TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST, I've been getting a very STRONG voice from God telling me to not tell them anything just yet, and to JUST pray for them, because the timing isn't right yet, and that they shouldn't hear it from me."

2756,"**Gospel: Luke 9:51-56** 

51 And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 52 and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. 53 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem. 54 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them ? 55 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.

\[Commentary\]

In Luke’s narrative there appears to be a gap of some time, weeks possibly months, after the events in verses 1-50 and 51-56.  Luke writes; “***51 And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 52 and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him***.”

Although Jesus had told them several times, they still did not understand or want to believe that he would go willingly to his death.  And ***the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up,***  it is time, Jesus instinctively knows he must now go to his destiny.  He therefore ***steadfastly sets his face***, he has resolved to go to Jerusalem and with determination he heads in that direction.   

Runners are dispatched ahead to arrange shelter for the entourage, we don’t know at this point how many there were, but in addition to the disciples there were many others, including Mary and other women who we are told went with him all the way to the end.

Jesus had up to this point a good relationship with the Samaritan people, and we can presume that those of that ethnicity were frustrated that Jesus would not spend time with them but was determined to go on to Jerusalem.  There was always a certain degree of tension between Samaritans and Jews even though they were cousins of sorts.  They probably felt discriminated against or somehow slighted, so they turned Jesus and the group of followers away.

When James and John heard of the Samaritan’s decision, they asked Jesus, “***...wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them***?”

James and John don't have the patience for the Samaritan’s blatant rejection of the Messiah. Their thoughts apparently go back to the northern kingdom's king Ahaziah who sought the insight of Baal-zebub as to whether he would recover from his injury. Elijah challenged his idolatry and called fire from heaven to destroy his sacrilegious messengers (2 Kings 1).   

This seems so out of character for two of the men who would in just a few months go on to establish what would become the Christian faith.  Perhaps their encounter with the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost mellowed them out a bit.

Jesus replied to their inquiry, “***Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. 56 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.***”  His rebuke is tantamount to saying; “Are you out of your minds?  I didn’t come to kill them but to save them!”   

It would be easy to assume that Jesus might have been frustrated at this point.  His time with them is short and they still don’t get it.  However he knew that when they had witnessed his crucifixion and resurrection, they would finally understand all that he had told them.

Unlike the disciples who witnessed all these miraculous things, we—on the other hand—must take all of it on faith, with our belief in him and all the things he taught 2000 years ago.   As we read in the remainder of the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, these people had their faith tested to the max, but they remained steadfast.  Today we endure many trials and tests; do you remain steadfast in your faith of Jesus?"
2757,"I was talking to some religious friends who had a problem with people saying “Blessed are you amongst women” instead of “Blessed are though amongst women.” I don’t understand why there is an insistence on sticking to the “purity” of the original wording when it’s a translation anyways from Greek or Hebrew or Latin. Since we’re translating anyways, shouldn’t we use the word that best translates? What are the reasons for this?"
2759,"My family is currently facing a difficult situation where my dad and mom want change but they don't change themselves and they always blame each other to change first.

2760,"To elaborate, would being in a homosexual relationship and not thinking its a sin, whilst still believing, worshipping and glorifying God, and spreading the Good News wherever one can, really be an issue?

I can't wrap my head around why God would make himself known/present in the lives of Homosexuals if they are so sinful and abominations. 

So why then are many homosexuals able to happily live, in love, knowing that (as Scripture says) all love comes from God, and still be called deeply sinful?

And with how debated the topic of homosexuality is, and how far both sides can fight on the specific translations and meaning, why do we even try to enforce this rule? If it isn't stopping people from loving God, and wanting him in their lives, what's the issue? 

With how much every denomination can fight on specific theological interpretations, why is there such a solid settlement with mainline ones around this issue when it is SO heavily and easily debated. All the verses talking about homosexuality, or at least the ones people always cite (personally I believe, and even biblically, the sin of Sodom was not homosexuality, its never said anywhere) are so easily turned around as not being about homosexuality, or modern homosexuality, or even apply nowadays due to cultural changes and changes to the Biblical Law. 

The only time I've seen homosexuality being an issue separating people from God is when people push them away from it for BEING a homosexual, nothing on them. For me this is the real thing. 

So many homosexuals I've met have wanted to have a relationship with God but have felt so pushed away by other Christians. Its a shame.

Sorry for the rant haha."
2762,"Some Lore:

Matthew 5:5

Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth. 

Psalm 37:11

But the meek shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace.

The dictionary defines meek as, “patient, mild mannered, not inclined to anger or resentment.” It lists as a synonym the word humble. It is important to note that the dictionary does not list weak as a synonym for meek. Although weakness and meekness may look and sound similar, they are not the same. Weakness is due to negative circumstances, such as lack of strength or courage. Meekness, however, is due to a person’s conscious choice. It is strength and courage under control, coupled with kindness.
That principle is found in the original Greek word for meek, “praus,” which was originally used in one special sense.

Had some strange thoughts on the past many commissions. As I get older I’m looking at “violence” in much a different way after reading scripture.
What’s really interesting though is so much of our modern culture and society is fed much entertainment that unfortunately promotes alot of violence. When I was younger I was grown up with the whole “knight fighting the dragon concept” I think most young buys do grow up with those thoughts

Seems I meet a lot of believers my age that are into the Armor of God concept might have something to do with the knights we thought of as kids. Plus all the entertainment we have now days at the touch of our finger tips most video games it’s extremely rare for you to be able to play as a pacifist

I tried adding a peace sign on the boots someone told me something about “meekness” and how it’s like having power under control. Kinda would like to have that vibe and not just have a flailing violent person wanting to fight anything but wanting to promote peace but if maybe your life came down to it or a demon or devil where maybe attacking you could stand your ground or protect others?

Just some deeper internal thoughts haha most people just wanna see knights though

2763,"just that, sins, are, forgiven"
2766,"Hey, I haven't read my bible in a while. I have a few reasons why but one of them is because I'm scared of it. When someone shares a verse, I am hesitant to read it because I don't know if it could be directed to me. I'm scared if it could say something about being destroyed, a hardened heart, tragedy, etc. 

I asked about a hardened heart before. They told me that if my heart was hardened, I would NOT care, at all. I wouldn't post this, I wouldn't care if I have rejected God, I wouldn't care about sin anymore. 

If that is the case, then that would mean that my heart hasn't been hardened right? I'm sorry for asking this but it's hard to believe that God hasn't made that decision yet. I've repeated my past a lot. It's complicated because even though I am asking, I don't think that I have been convicted. So I'm confused as to why I feel like this."
2767,"What exactly does that mean? The people in the verses thought they were following God even to the point of casting out demons and prophesying. Have you ever done those things? I haven’t... Not that salvation is based on works, but you would need God to do those things and I don’t have God on that level. This verse makes me feel more inferior like I should expect Hell. It can sound like serve me or Hell, but there will be people who serve me their whole lives and will get to the end of their lives, and I will say depart from me I never knew you. How could one ever know?"
2769,"Hello. When I was in college and graduate school we were still immersed in French and American Post-Structuralism and I read a lot of that stuff. I enjoyed it too. Derrida, who is considered the ""founder"" of Deconstruction as a critical activity is a contentious writer but I enjoyed the things of his I took the trouble to work through, even if I didn't always agree. I know that term has entered the public consciousness in a way that isn't directly related to Derrida's specific praxis, but I've been hearing a lot more over the last year or two in relation to Evangelicals leaving their faith. Especially on this sub, which makes sense I suppose.

But I'm curious. I was never in Evangelical circles so I've no context whatsoever about what this even means. Is it related to Derridean Deconstruction? Are there post-Evangelical writers using dense late 20th century philosophy to reflect upon their own faith? Or is it more that the term was borrowed from the pop-culture use of it as synonymous, essentially, with critical evaluation in general? I've even seen people say they are ""deconstructed."" What does that mean? The most I ever heard from Christian writers was that it was a bad thing, like all ""post-modernism"" because they assume it was just another way to be nihilistic or skeptical. But now it's a popular thing.

And to be clear: I think it's cool and interesting. I don't care about the ""correct"" use of the term, and I'm happy to see people using whatever tools they have available to make better lives for themselves and naming them whatever they want. I just want to know for the sake of my own curiosity. Thanks!"

He said that's what I like to hear your body is a temple by believing in him we have become one with the lord. Idk if I came across some wacko mystic or what did this gave me weird vibes.

2773,"I apologize if it's a ramble show 

Throughout my entire life up until this point I've had it rough emotionally. I'm the youngest child of 5, during my early years I learnt that my grandma on my dad's side didn't like me she always liked my brother better. When I was approaching 10 my parents always used to fight in the house and I learnt a few years later my dad was cheating and this was after the divorce. Shortly after the divorce my grandma on my mom's side was murdered when I was 11 and I took it really hard. She was very religious and gifted me my first read to me bible, I love that book and still have it I went to therapy because of that. I really loved her so that hit me very hard. My teen years were no less difficult, I was bullied for my entire school career until I finished it and I never had many friends until one day they basically left me to hang out with the guys who bullied me so that was another notch. In my last few years of school my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I found out from her tablet I was using one day. She started chemo and the doctors thought she was gonna make a recovery until one day she took a bad turn. She didn't make it, she raised me by herself and that time my world fell apart I've never felt so much pain even in my previous times in life. I had to grow up quite fast because it was do or die basically I'm surprised I didn't because a statistic. I've never had time to deal with most of my trauma and it's honestly damaged me a lot even to this day. Now to where I need advice. After all I've been through I've tried to keep my head up and pray to God to help me through my struggles and I think he's the only reason I didn't become a phone call to my family but lately I've been going through a rough patch again I spend some nights choking back tears unable to say a prayer I'm told God hears even your tears so I hope he doesn't mind me prattling on. I just want to know if anyone can give me advice on why after all I've been through, survived and all the changes made to me why do I still hurt so much I'm starting to lose my grip and honestly just want to fall. 

Sorry for the ramble I'm having another crying session as I type this. Thanks for reading if you did."

When I called out to God to help me  I was filled with the Holy Spirit and felt no fear and I knew it was God that saved me. I hadn’t been attacked in that way since then which was about 10 years ago. I’ve had a lot of my non believer friends tell me about their experiences. Even some of them have happened while I was visiting them and of course I prayed over them and bought them a Bible and told them that God is the only one who can save them. It always worked for them in the beginning but once they continued on in their lives not truly believing they would come back. I have never stopped believing in God and I would consider myself to be very strong in my faith but now some horrible sins have come out in my family again (same type of sin that came to light when I had my first and only sleep paralysis attack 10 years ago) from a very close family member. And last night I had an experience that I am not sure 100% if it was a demonic attack. I have had some medical issues recently having to do with my heart & circulation and I wonder if it may have something to do with this now. I was having a normal dream about driving around with my friend and I heard this very loud deep voice similar to the one from my previous experience. It said something that may sound silly but I think it may have just been trying to confuse me so that I would speak to it? It yelled at me saying “Where can I get an answering machine!!!!” It wasn’t a part of my dream either. The voice literally woke me out of my dream. I wasn’t paralyzed at all, I was just scared. I had my eyes closed still because I was confused that I wasn’t in my dream anymore. Then I felt a very very hard pounding on my back. Like someone was trying to poke me to get my attention but with their fist. I realized that it was real so I started praying to God to help me and the fear went away but my heart was pounding harder than it ever has before to the same cadence that I had been getting hit. It didn’t start to slow down until I fully sat up in my bed. I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. I read my Bible before I went to bed that night and listened to worship music. The only sin I have committed recently has been holding anger in my heart towards that family member but I have been battling everyday to forgive them because I love them, I just hate their sin. Any idea of what I’m dealing with here? "
2776,"Remember god has a plan for You 
Remember What he has done for You

2777,"My husband and I are getting baptized tomorrow and though he is gung ho about it, I have been feeling just down and conflicted and I guess just not worthy to say the least.

Back in March of 2022 I lost my mom to colorectal cancer. My husband and I were her caretakers and it was the absolute hardest thing in my life. We were there when she took her last breath. This woman had the strongest faith I’ve ever seen in my life. She was maybe 60 lbs in her final days and would still lift her arms in praise to Him. 

Two days before she passed away she was nonverbal. She sat up looked me in the eyes and asked if I was pregnant. Which of course my response was no. I didn’t want kids. It was not my plan (let’s all take a moment to laugh at that like I’m in control) but I was too selfish and liked living my life with my husband and our two cats and a pup. I was also on birth control for over ten years and didn’t even think it was possible having just gotten off of it a month before. 

Turns out my mom was right. I was pregnant. I told her the day after. That night she passed away. I was spiraling, but it was also the closest I have ever felt to God.

Flash forward to now and I don’t know why I’m struggling so much. I don’t know if it’s my own struggles. I don’t know if it’s the devil in my ear. I do think about how my mom always wanted to get baptized and it just never happened for her.

I guess what I’m really just trying to get at is I feel lost, I feel unworthy, and I just wish my mom was her to give me her guidance she always had for me even in her final days"
2778,"We all can probably relate with Moses; he had some insecurities when God gave him the commision to act as his envoy to Pharoah and the Israelites. 

Exodus 3:10 
Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt

Exodus 3:16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.
 

I can only imagine how  jittery and unnerved Moses was while he said what could have probably sounded like this in present times:   ""look, I am not your guy, who I'm I that I should go to Pharoah? Who would I tell them sent me?""

Exo 3:11 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 

And...

Exodus 3:13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them


However, God answered him in the most reassuring yet powerful way: 

Exodus 3:14 And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you.

Has God impressed a Vision or a call upon your heart? You probably have a million and one questions, uncertainties and insercurities. however,  if the "" I AM THAT I AM""  truly sent you, that is all you need!"

2780,"The works of man do not add, nor subtract, from the majesty of God.

but that the earth and all that is here, is for man's spiritual development.

Too many claim to be ""christians"", while living almost exclusively as materialists. and all too often, there are souls which treat ""jesus"" like a cheat code. That all you must do is punch in j-e-s-u-s and you will be tolerated to sin and to ignore the sufferings of others and the corrupt practices in this world.

If people would work together toward heaven on earth, rather than laboring for your own personal worldly kingdom (land, house, mowed lawn, new car, etc) then life for all would IMMEDIATELY be significantly more beautiful.

If the churches would unlock their doors, stop paving parking lots, and liberate people from lives of monetary poverty. If your tithes would go toward good works, rather than toward paying for another locked church, another parking lot and the church electric bill.

If the people who claim to believe, would humble themselves and live with modest wants, rather than to glorify their own temporary life, and would put their energy and works toward others.

There is no top to this world.

Once you have inherited the entire earth, then below your feet are pillars of poverty and suffering and slaughter-houses."
2781,"I don’t think the Holy Spirits in me. Like I don’t think I feel bad for sin. I don’t want to commit sin but every time I do it I feel bad for a while and then I am disappointed with my self and then I repent it’s gone. Like Idk I don’t think GODs in my life. I think I have committed the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit because like I don’t have anything. I feel like GOD is absent in my life along with the Holy Spirit. Like I accept that JESUS is lord and he died for me, and I asked him to enter my heart like I am doubting I truly trust in him like I am a false Christian.



I just feel so, Bad."
2782,"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.

Here we see that if you belong to Christ then therefore you are the seed of Abraham...

What does it mean to be the seed of Abraham?

You have to read the covenant in Genesis to understand that promise. You are not exempt from the covenant if you are truly Christ's and claim therefore to be a child of Abraham...

""And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after the in their generations [that means always being renewed- ongoing -current] for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee...(Genesis 18:12)""

God makes promise to give the land and to be their God (Genesis 18:7)

And He writes- ""this is my covenant which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; every man child among you shall be circumcized.
And ye shall circumcize the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you."" (Genesis 18:8)

Paul reiterates time and again in his letter (Galatians)  that if you claim to be Christ's that means you are heir to Abraham. Therefore you must adopt the terms and conditions given to Abraham, what does it mean to be a child of the promise?? And then therefore you are a debtor to do the whole law, if you are Abraham's seed you are entered into the ongoing covenant of Christ

""For I testify again to every man that is circumcized that he is a debtor to do the whole law (Galatians 3:3).""

Because you must be dead to the law in order to live unto Christ (for I through the law am dead to the law that I might live unto God -galatians 3:19)...

Because it is necessary to be dead to the law to live unto Christ. You can't be Abraham's seed without entering into that covenant, and you can't live unto Christ without being subject to the law. Even Abraham was. You are not exempt. The law was also an act of mercy and grace by the way, not some filthy rag or awful thing. It was an honor and a blessing, not a hindrance and a burden.

As Christ died on the cross before being resurrected, so you must be dead in the law in order to also be resurrected with Him in life. That is what he means when he says pick up your cross and follow me. He says His yoke is easy and His burden light. Notice that there is still a yoke and there is still a burden. Those are not bad things. 

And this all applies to women too. We're not second class citizens.

Today I (20m)  decided to break up after a long relationship with another dude (21m). There was many reasons for it but the main one is that I simply felt like I absolutely hate this lifestyle and want to give myself entirely to Christ. It was a hard decision and painful but I need to know - will that get any easier from now on? I have only Christ now in my life and I believe it is enough for me to thrive. God bless you all.

2792,"So as i read my bible and attend church daily (Protestant) i grew up Baptist my family is hardcore Christians which is fine, anyway i had a conversation with my mother and to give you guys some context: 

My bestfriend three years ago was in a car crash which resulted in the passenger passing away, the female passenger  that passed away was Christian , My friend  was speeding they came from a bar and he was racing with a friend , on her instagram it was clear she was struggling with going out drinking (She said so herself) and was bold about her faith, however when i spoke to this with my mother she said "" It was God's Wrath that put his hand on that passenger and thats why she died"" , 

Now my question really is, Does Gods wrath really like that? Does God ''Kill"" us prematurely if we are deep in sin, because if thats the truth wouldnt that defeat the purpose of free will? Where in the bible states that Jesus refers to Gods wrath as a punishment when we are alive on earth?

I Appreciate everyone "
2793,"I recently have been smacked in the face with my mortality. I’m not scared of death but the after. So many people tell me about heaven. But when I think about dying and just - poof - gone. It fills my stomach with dread. 

Do you have an instance in life that made you believe their is an afterlife? Not just going with what we are told and taught. I’m struggling and it makes me so scared."
2794,"I don't mean this post in a negative way but I'm wondering how I should take it when people of religious (or even non-believing) circles are blunt and persuasive.

Oftentimes people can assert their views on Christianity, Jesus and the Bible being the absolute truth or they could correct me according to their doctrines.

Or they could try to convert non-believers or be persistent in getting me to join them in their communities.

How should I take this? Is this beyond the social etiquette norm or is this acceptable? Why do they do this?"
2795,"Jesus taught us to...
Welcome the stranger.
Set the captives free.
Feed the hungry.
Cure the sick.
Lift the lowly.
Love thy neighbor.

Society teaches us to...
Close doors on those who seek refuge.
Jail those who we judge.
Feed only those who can afford to pay.
Cure the sick for profit.
Shun those who we perceive to be beneith us.
Hate and oppress those who are different than us.

Following Christ means to put in the work; helping others, being kind and speaking against oppression. But many of those who call themselves Christians defend the doctorine of a heartless society; worshipping the rich and powerful, and shunning the poor and needy. I don't understand the disconnect within individuals who call themselves Christians but disregard the words of Jesus Christ. Help me understand."

I'm a teenager who lives in the US, but I traveled to my hometown in India (my birthplace) with my family over summer break. Unfortunately, we've had a lot of trouble getting back home due to visa issues. I live in a very rural area here, so I haven't been able to go to the gym or be very active. Unfortunately, I have been acting very sinful lately, and have been very hopeless in my life overall.

 School has already started back home, and im moving to a different state which makes it even worse. Im a hindu, but the more I've been reading about Christianity the more I've started to love its teachings and love Jesus. I don't know much about actually praying however, which is why I've come here. How do I pray that me and my family can come back home as quickly as possible, to keep living a good healthy life? And can you guys please pray for me?

Sorry if this rant was too long, I can answer any questions if you guys have any. Thank you in advance."
2805,"My daughter is going to kindergarten at a Catholic school (we are protestant).  I'm thinking ahead to Christmas gifts, which I'll likely make in my wood shop.  Teacher gifts will be on a scroll saw (hence I want time).  I don't have a good grasp of Catholic tradition and I'm hoping you'll help screen my ideas.  Likewise, I don't know the kindergarten teacher well enough to pick out specific interests so I'm guessing.  I respect the traditions, just don't understand them.

A crucifix.  See https://www.stevedgood.com/catalog and search crucifix (sorry, the Web site won't let me link directly!).

We've see the principal wearing a Jerusalem cross (every time we see her!).  So I'm thinking about carving that into the lid of a keepsake box.

Also the school logo, it's a lion on a 2 tone blue plaque.  I've also thought about doing a carving of St Jerome but that's a big project and might be too much this year.  I have thoughts about how I'd pull it off though.

For classmates, probably table saw stars.  They are tricky to get started but easy to batch out, and my daughter loves to paint.  I couldn't find a short video but here's a long one that thankfully has examples at the beginning.  https://youtu.be/Z-vXWxwHii0?si=t6B4omMs1QyawqKt

My question ... are these good gift choices, coming from a protestant family?  Any tradition/etc. issues I should be aware of?

Thanks!"
2806,"My name is kyden and I went to church for three first time in a very long time recently. I was in a catholic church but I'm still an undecided Christian. The entire time I was in church I was having extremely unpure thoughts that I couldn't control. Some examples are destroying church property, thoughts of yelling out that its all fake, sex with a majority of female church goers and assaulting the priest. I have no clue what to do. I can't control the thoughts but I never act on them. I also recently started having the urge to steal and stole twice. I have begged for forgiveness and confesses my sins but I can't help but feel like I'm not doing something right. Any advice helps. Thank you."
2807," Heavenly Father,

As the dawn breaks and a new day unfolds, we come before You with hearts filled with gratitude and hope. We seek Your guidance, strength, and blessings for the day ahead, trusting in Your unwavering love and promises.

Psalm 5:3 reminds us, ""In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice; in the morning, I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly."" We approach You with confidence, knowing that You hear our prayers and answer them according to Your perfect will.

Lord, grant us the wisdom of Psalm 119:105: ""Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path."" Illuminate our path today with Your Word, that we may make wise decisions and walk in the path of righteousness.

Psalm 90:17 says, ""May the favor of the Lord our God rest on us; establish the work of our hands for us—yes, establish the work of our hands."" We humbly ask for Your favor and guidance in all our endeavors, that our efforts may be fruitful and aligned with Your purpose.

Psalm 37:5 encourages us to ""Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this."" We commit our plans and aspirations to You, trusting that You will lead us to success in accordance with Your divine plan.

Fill our hearts with courage and perseverance, as expressed in Psalm 27:14: ""Wait for the Lord; be strong and take heart and wait for the Lord."" We patiently await Your timing and trust that You will open doors of opportunity.

As we go about our day, may Psalm 19:14 be our prayer: ""May these words of my mouth and this meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer."" Let our words and actions bring glory to Your name.

We ask for protection, as mentioned in Psalm 91:11-12: ""For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone."" Shield us from harm and grant us safety.

In conclusion, Heavenly Father, we entrust this day to Your care, knowing that with You, all things are possible (Matthew 19:26). May Your presence be our constant companion, and may our endeavors be aligned with Your will.

In the name of Your Son, Jesus Christ, we pray.

Amen.

2808,"My freinds are Christians so we share alot of the same values . I try and fail to be the best Christian I can be by reading of listening to the bible everyday and pray the rosary as much as I can

These freinds are very much against the lgbtq community,  Jews , fat people and sometimes comments about woman . I make some riskey jokes sometimes but that is what they are jokes whereas when my freinds say these things they are not. They seem to judge others sin so harshly even tho they commit there own sins. They start unwanted debates with me and my brother who also finds it frustrating because they have never read the bible and we have numerous times .

One constantly tells me he wants to be a monk . How can I address there hate .it is making me want to not be freinds with them anymore due to my more positive and carefree view on life . I have quite a few non binary and gay freinds ."
2809,(M). I get bad thoughts in my mind that says I will go to hell because of my sins  and I believe in Jesus death  for my sins and that he love’s me (how do I deal with these thoughts )
2810," Don’t be discouraged due to failures. Don't despair when having no way out. Remember: We have God with us! 

 Living in this world filled with darkness and evil, we have too much suffering and frustration. Only God can bring us hope and light. The Lord Jesus said, “I am the light of the world: he that follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). 

📖God says, “The Almighty has mercy on these people who have suffered deeply; at the same time, He is fed up with these people who lack consciousness, as He has had to wait too long for an answer from humanity. He wishes to seek, to seek your heart and your spirit, to bring you water and food and to awaken you, that you may no longer be thirsty and hungry. When you are weary and when you begin to feel something of the bleak desolation of this world, do not be lost, do not cry. Almighty God, the Watcher, will embrace your arrival at any time. He is keeping watch by your side, waiting for you to turn back around. He is waiting for the day you suddenly recover your memory: when you realize that you came from God, that, at some unknown time you lost your direction, at some unknown time you lost consciousness on the road, and at some unknown time acquired a ‘father’; when you realize, furthermore, that the Almighty has always been keeping watch, waiting there a very, very long time for your return. He has been watching with desperate longing, waiting for a response without an answer. His watching and waiting are beyond any price, and they are for the sake of the human heart and the human spirit. Perhaps this watching and waiting are indefinite, and perhaps they are at an end. But you should know exactly where your heart and your spirit are right now.” 

📖God says, “Because the essence of God is holy, that means that only through God can you walk through life on the righteous path of light; only through God can you know the meaning of life; only through God can you live out real humanity and both possess and know the truth. Only through God can you obtain life from the truth. Only God Himself can help you shun evil and deliver you from the harm and control of Satan. Besides God, no one and nothing can save you from the sea of suffering so that you suffer no longer. This is determined by the essence of God.” 

💁Friends, after reading God’s words, do you feel God’s care and love for us?  "
2811,"I’m a 25yo male, I’ve been a believer for 3 years and I’ve been trying my hardest to make something happen. I’ve been volunteering, tithing, and doing all the other things I thought would would help my faith. Praying has become so hard because nothing I pray for ever seems to happen. I read the Bible every day, but it isn’t really helping either 

The few close friends I did have at church got married in the past few years, so I don’t get to spend much time with them anymore. Everyone else at the church is always busy doing stuff with their families or just busy with other stuff.

 I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere, and I’m not happy with my life. I want to be married, and have kids, but I don’t really know where to look. Most of the women at the church are out of my age range or are already in a relationship. I’m not seeing fruit in any other areas of my life either. I know God works on his own time and has his own will, but I don’t know what to do anymore.

What would you do?"
2812, Why Do People Sin? How to Stop Sinning?
2813,Usually I just keep quiet but I'm now wondering if that's the right thing to do.
2814,"A little bit about me....  My dad is Protestant (Lutheran-ELCA) and my mom and wife are both Catholic.  I grew up in the Lutheran-ELCA church which supports open communion.  My mom also took communion in the ELCA church.  Every now and then, my mom would go to a Catholic Church (after all, she IS a Catholic) and invite me to go with her.  As I got older, she would encourage me to take communion.  When I got married, my wife would tell me ""it's up to you.  that's between you and God"" when I asked her about communion.  I was confirmed in the ELCA church but have since become non-denominational.  


Scripture tells us that those who do not eat the bread (body of Christ) shall not live an eternal life (John 6:35, John 6:53). There is a verse that people use to defend the idea of closed communion (1 Corinthians 11:27-32), though to be honest, the interpretation of this scripture can get VERY subjective and twisted around.

1 Corinthians 1:10 and Galatians 3:27-29 both support the concept that those who believe and follow in Jesus are united and one in the eyes of God.

I've always attended Catholic communion based on the belief that scripture commands us to be united as Christians, not divided.  We are Christians (not Catholic Christians) who are baptized and follow Jesus as our savior.  I've only had one Catholic priest reject me during communion (he gave me a blessing instead).  It was at my wedding and he learned that I was not Catholic.  But I've never read any scripture that shows Jesus rejecting anyone who wanted to eat the bread.  


Curious to know what everyone's thoughts are?"
2815,"
If satan is thrown down to earth, why does Isaiah 14:12 say that he destroyed the nations of ""the world"". Doesn't this imply that he destroyed nations in some realm or form and then later was thrown down to earth.

You get what I mean? My question is what nations are meant by it, if he was thrown down to earth after destroying those mentioned nations.

Of course there are other reasons why satan was thrown down. But what nations are meant, if they are not the nations of earth?"
2816,"I don’t listen to demonic music that deliberately goes against God. I stay away from that. 

But I HAVE listened to other types of music. Mostly ones that have to do with heartbreak, and all that type of stuff. Their mostly sad though. 

I also listen to Gospel music as well. 

Is listening to sad heartbreak music a bad thing to do? I’ve been staying away from it in case."
2817,"This is probably going to seem like a ridiculous question or statement or whatever you want to call it but I was wondering how often I should have communion who I should have it with can I have it by myself and is there specific ""products"" I need to buy.

""Products"" meaning bread and wine or extra things such as clothing, books or anything else like that."
2818,"I myself am Christian but struggling a lot with my faith right now.

But back to you, why do you believe that there is something as opposed to nothing? In what ways has the truth been revealed to you? Why are you not skeptical?"
2819,"I have been attending a charismatic church, which is a oneness apostolic Pentecostal church. Obviously this church rejects the Trinity and believes in Oneness, baptism in Jesus’ name is required for Salvation, and you don’t have the Holy Ghost unless you speak in tongues. Yesterday the pastor even taught a whole message on having sound doctrine. That this church was one of few that taught the correct doctrine and kind of bashed all of the trinitarian churches and said “just read in Acts. They baptized in Jesus’ name and they didn’t teach the Trinity. They taught One God.” 

Obviously I don’t believe this. I’m a trinitarian. I’ve been attending this church due to the girl I’m dating…. 

However when I look at Matthew 7:15-20 it says we should be able to tell false prophets by their fruits. This pastor in particular will often speak and say he has been given “apostolic authority.” Most of his messages are correct, until he begins speaking about doctrine. My question is how can I be sure that this is a false doctrine when there aren’t any necessarily “bad fruits” that I can see from him or other leaders within the church. They are all super kind, loving, respectful, etc."
2820,"Hello all, I recently have been on a religious sort of journey as I've hit a crossroads in my life. Today I woke up feeling terrible the first time in a few days but I said a prair of gratitude and things did get slightly better. I found out later my step great grandmother was found unconscious in the care home. I prayed for God's direction and asked them to give her support in this time of need. This evening she has made a full verbal recovery and has only shown further symptoms of a UTI (which is common and treatable for her age). Furthermore my partner has been taken in for induction today and everything has been okay with her since. Sometimes I feel connected to this bigger picture than me and my brain and that's what brought me former agnostic (but mainly nihilist) over to religion. It feels as if now my body brain and soul has expanded. Thank you all please pray for her to have a quick birth.

Also furthermore is there any etiquette to praying I usually start with a brief meditation to set the mind at ease and beggin with talking under my breath on my own is there anymore I could/should do? Much love guys"
2821,"Sophianism is a spiritual devotion within the broader spectrum of Christian thought that emphasizes the personification of wisdom, known as Sophia. The name ""Sophia"" is derived from the Greek word for wisdom.

Contemporary Sophianism venerates holy Sophia, the spirit of wisdom, as a highly exalted, personal, feminine spirit who was present with God during the act of creation. She serves as a nurturing guide to help us navigate the spiritual realm.

Alongside her are five other created spirits, the spirits of understanding (Biynah), counsel (Etsah), might (Gebuwrah), knowledge (De’ah), and the fear of the Lord (Yirah). These spirits, together with the Holy Spirit, complete the seven Spirits of God. They illuminate our spiritual path like the colors of a rainbow, each offering its unique hue of divine light.

To engage more deeply with this belief system, the Sophian Rosary has emerged as a spiritual tool designed to foster a connection to the divine. Through a series of reflective prayers and meditations, practitioners contemplate each of the seven Spirits in turn, nurturing a growing sense of spiritual enlightenment and familiarity with the spirits.

Contemporary Sophianism is deeply rooted in Christian scripture, drawing heavily from biblical wisdom literature like the books of Proverbs, Wisdom of Solomon, and Ecclesiasticus (Sirach). It not only introduces new spiritual practices, but also serves as a lens through which believers can engage with ancient texts.

If you feel a pull towards this wisdom journey and wish to dive deeper, please visit the [r/Sophianism](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sophianism/) subreddit, a small, but welcoming community devoted to Sophia and the seven Spirits."
2822,"I recently returned to faith after a few years of chaos and I’ve felt God leading me towards sharing my faith with a friend of mine who is really struggling with life. My friend has plenty of questions, has seen the change in me and identifies with my testimony, but I struggle to explain exactly what the gospel is in ‘real terms’. I can tell them what God has done in my life, that I don’t fear or worry anymore, that I’ve been made new and such but I fall down trying to explain what the gospel may do for them. What is the best way to explain the Gospel to someone in this situation?"
2823,"How can I be sure im saved. Currently trying to stop smoking just the anxiety and unsure unsuredness of my salvation has led me down a rabbit hole of anxiety and fear and is partially why I do smoke.

Edit from what I can tell god doesnt gaf so thanks for yalls input. I'm a pretty fucked up guy nicotine is just a vice to keep me sane"
2824,"I just can't escape it. Lust is everywhere. I'm being sexually abused at the moments and cannot leave. i don't want to do it anymore. I have a lovely boyfriend to cares for me, but I can't even treat him how he deserves and even then- although we're long distance- I always give into that lust and get so caught up in those lustful feelings. It makes him happy- i love him- how do I tell him no? My abuse has made me hypersexual. Just as Paul said he does contrary to what the Spirit wants him to do, even if it hurts him- I feel exactly the same. I keep going back. even if I try to improve I can't. I don't deserve God. I don't deserve His forgiveness if this keeps happening. I'm totally ruined and I'm sorry. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm just tired and wish God would just take me home already. There's so many good things I can do but I feel like I'll never be good enough for God. I always go back to lust and right now- if I want to cope- there's no escaping it. My hormones are jacked and my doctors won't help- they just give me medicines that make it so much worse. God please help me. I hate myself.  


There's nothing I can do but getting it out of my system and ranting helps. I'm sorry. Please forgive me."
2825,"Hey all, so I was reading my Bible yesterday and stumbled on this verse and it really got me rethinking what I thought the rules were on divorce and remarrying, and it seems the community is very divided on this subject. This is the verse:

""And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except *it be* for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: **and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.**"" -  Matthew 19:9

It seems the last section of this verse says that whoever even marries a divorce commits adultery, and it doesn't say it excludes those who got divorced because of there partner committing fornication/sexual immorality...    but it seems like many teachers/preachers regard it so?

What do people think? If one gets a divorce are they destined to then stay single unless the partner dies and becomes a widow which the Bible allows? (Romans 7:2-3).

This is a **VERY** serious topic, because its salvational (1 Corinthians 6:9-11).

2826,"Spiritual growth is the process of becoming more like God and developing a deeper relationship with Him. 

To achieve this, we must regularly read and study the Bible, pray, attend church and participate in fellowship with other believers. I also personally suggest the ‘Glorify’ app as it breaks things down for you so that you’re better able to understand scripture.

We must also strive to obey God's commands and follow His will for our lives. Through these actions, we can grow in our faith and become more spiritually mature. 

As it is written in 2 Peter 3:18, ""But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and forever. Amen."
2828,"why  Jesus is unique, but there are more than 2000 factions in religious world? "
2829,"Is it a sin? 

Like me I think it’s a sin, because it’s a form of sexual immorality because it’s sexual intercourse outside of marriage as well as Lust because when you are inflamed with Lust you tend to masterbate and so it’s as sin. 

But I easily get lied to and I am confused so can someone help"
2831,"For those introvert Christians, what ministry are you in? and how you find yourself being part of it?"
2832,I do penis enlargement like a pump etc  ( it works ) but I doing it for myself and for future wife ! Do use think it’s ok to do as long as it’s not out of lust or for one night stands etc ?
2833,"I think this is just coming from doubt. But do we even have any evidence that the apostles existed? Like Paul, for example. How do we know he’s not just some made up person a bunch of people starting a religion came up with? And Jesus himself, how do we know he’s not just made up too?"
2834,"**1.** **“Be true to yourself.”**

Jesus said, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross…” (Matthew 16:24 ESV)

**2.** **“Follow your heart.”**

Jesus said, “…follow me.” (Matthew 16:24 ESV)

**3.** **“Believe in yourself.”**

Jesus said, “Believe in God; believe also in me.” (John 14:1 ESV)

**4.** **“Live your truth.”**

Jesus said, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6 ESV)

**5.** **“As long as you are happy.”**

Jesus said, “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?” (Matthew 16:26 ESV)"
2835,"The idea of having an all loving and holy father protecting me, helping me, loving me sounds absolutely beautiful but there’s so much reason to not believe in him. Now I’m sure there’s plenty of reasons I should but I just don’t have faith in it, I really want to but it’s hard. All my friends are atheists so they don’t ever talk about religion or anything spiritual so I can never ask about it. Anything to help me? 15 M"
2837,"As a new christian I have a question, if I'm so important to God, and he loves me so much. Why arent I doing great things like elon musk who cares nothing for God. Why are so many 'repobate'  people living how they please achieving what they please, and enjoying life as they please. Why arent I among those people? Why am I poor special needs and struggling to make it while they boast how great they are. Am I really specially chosen in a world that's unfair like it is?"
2838,Seems like love is the only thing that can soften a hardened heart.
2841,I heart that many people say they think their churchs change a lot. and they prefer to study bible at home. so Can you share with me the differences in your feelings between going to church before and going to church now? 
2842,"I have never seen him in the act but I have seen traces such as the search History of his various apps.
Sometimes I even see specific names of these pornstars on the searches.
Deep inside i feel very hurt and it makes me accuse him of fantasizing about other women. He denies fantasizing about other women and states ""it's just to get the heat out"" and it doesn't matter whoever the actress was. He says he has no fantasies about one specific girl, any actress ""does the job"". He even guilt trips me into ""don't worry. Just be thankful i am not cheating on you like the other husbands out there. Aren't you thankful i am just watching and not doing it in real life?""

I am still hurt and do not know how to respond to this. He does not sound apologetic at all does he? Or is it all in my head like he says?
I don't feel like I'm in a state of grace at all because all I can think about is pain, disappointment and revenge.
This makes me feel like i am not enough.

I don't think he will come with me to a priest or a pastor to get this sorted out."
2843,"My parents and my siblings and I are different. We think differently and do things differently. In my faith, I believe I have even predicted many things. And ever since that I am always the one to push everyone. Even towards true doctrine. I may not fully understand myself but thats what I believe that I shouldnt stay and leave everyone to be on my own. I do not need to be around anyone from my family. 

They were too hard on themselves, have false doctrine, listen to false teachers and defend them, my father would be mean, bad advice from everyone except my mother, sighing from my brother constantly, my sister becoming more and more awkward, my father disrespecting me and even having contempt towards everyone, no one visits the house, I took my dog for surgery meanwhile my father didnt care after our first dog died that couldve been prevented, my father diverting constantly and never explaining anything, my father exaggerted over his job and cannot even accept thats his career and still have regrets even as a christian, my father doesnt get to the point in things and complains about time, my father doesnt understand how to socialize, I got married and my father cant say anything good about my wife even as he is right that im being used he would either criticize her or say nothing, He would also tell me as Im 27 years old and its 2023 after many years to still tell me where to walk and who to be with during a grocery shopping errand, and more things. 

The thing is it has taken a toll on me sometimes. I am up to explain more if Im asked. I am up for criticism from my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. I know the word has said about leaving your family but in this case I felt like I was and still am the one to tell everyone what to do. Mentally. Even spiritually. I have my own issues which is why I question to leave or not. But without me, and I hope Im not being self-centered, everyone at my house needs me to show them what to do. Even if they dont realise. I have confronted my father countless times to hear him say the things I prayed about he would say. And for me it is confirmation. Samething with everyone else. I stepped in even when not asked or being talked to. However, I think I was still right. And that gives me a driving force. I dont stop until I think its a go ahead type of thing. 

I am unemployed, and I havent worked in like 3 months now. However, I have learned more things than I ever did the past many years. It isnt worth it until I know its good. I have predicted about my jobs and it does happen. So now I dont listen to anyone until I can overcome that. Because it was the samething that helped me in those times too. I should've listen to it in the first place when I was younger. I believe it is the Holy Spirit. I am closer to God and things work out better than before.

I am not perfect nor do I have everything down to the teeth. Its my question whether I should altogether leave or continue to help everyone out. Once I find a job, I would probably leave. That basically its my only thing to do than worry about everyone. I do not believe I have a log in my eye and everyone has a spec. I do not believe its the case. Things have changed and I believe it was because of me. But I could be wrong. And Seperating myself from my extended family has helped me to be myself to think for myself and have my priorites straight. I give credit to God."
2844,"the people say ""tolerate us, that we cause poverty in the earth. Tolerate our polluting of water and causing famine in the land.
Allow us to neglect our children in preference of monetery and material gain.
Let all enslave the masses to fences and posted signs, preventing the animals and preventing all people from dwelling on the earth.
Tolerate us, that our machines sink into the ears of all people and all creatures, continually without end.
Do not judge us! Allow us to our destruction. Tolerate our slaughter houses so that we might eat flesh day and night without moderation.
Let our daughters sell their bodies for money, let our sons and daughters go off and die in wars against the sons and daughters of another nation.

Dont judge us. Say nothing.
Seek only your own peace in the midst of our oppressions and wastings.
Go off, far from us, that we might not hear your concern for the innocent and the poor.
Let us waste the earth in the name of God.
for we are saved to sin, and we see no pain nor suffering,
for under our own roof is much treasure, and our own works have made us fat in this temporary dream.
Do not declare what eyes can see and ears can hear and hearts can feel and what the mind can reason.
For we have denied such things within our selves and are like the dead.
Do not make us feel!
Do not remind us of freedom while we are bound in chains of fear.
Do not remind us of life or truth or of our divine nature."
2846,"For the past year I''ve been talking to this girl I met online. We kind of just talked through text up until the past couple of months. We decided to try video chatting and it's gotten us alot closer. We talk amost every day and she's such a sweetheart. I've grown to love everything about her. She has a great sense of humor, she loves animals and is super smart. She speaks like 5 languages. I've never felt this strongly about anyone before. She's Hindu and has been all of her life. I'm a Christian, we've talked about our beliefs and she's actually let me pray for her a couple of times. If anyone has any tips or experiance in this area I'd really appreciate some help. Prayer would be great too."
2848,"Please give me hope through testimony or advice. I was sexually active from 17-21 years old. In those years I did not have a relationship with Jesus. I am now 22 turning 23 and have not had sexual relations since then after being saved by Jesus. In God’s timing I would like to be blessed with a relationship where my partner & I practice abstinence & only having sexual relations after getting married. I sometimes doubt if that is possible for me because of my sinful past, struggling with sexual temptations, & this generation."
2849,"The red letters represent JESUS'S word, what he actually spoke.
Then you have eyewitness/or ""another person said, this is what Jesus told me accounts

Why are most bibles no longer ""red letter?""

2850,"I am giving my body, mind, and soul to Jesus Christ. I am not going to follow religious institutions. I believe God is calling me to be non-denominational, bible believing, born again Christian, follower of The Way. I believe Jesus Christ is Lord and Savior. I repent of all my sins. I do not want to commit them again. I believe we are saved by faith, not of works, so no man can boast. Does that mean we should sin? God forbid. But we have a mediator with The Father when we do, Christ Jesus. I am going to commit myself to loving God, so I think I will limit my time on the computer from now on, because I love God with all my heart and soul and want to spend time with Him with his Word, the gospel, the Holy Bible. I believe the Gospel. The good news of Jesus Christ. He died for our sins and rose from the dead. I hope all to be saved. If you are still deciding about God, please come to Him, we are running out of time  (He is coming soon)!"
2851,"I don't what word other than offensive to use. I want to go to church, despite my lack of belief in God, because I've eternally been impressed by Christianity and would like to be a part of it by going to my local Methodist Church. Would that be a wrong thing to do?"

As a questioning Christian who is still learning about the religion, I seem to have many similarities with orthodox views.

He no longer attends church  regularly with our family and laughs off any concerns I have for his  salvation. He says he is not transgender but is instead a ""femboy"". He  frequently wears women's clothes, makeup, and paints his nails, both  inside the house and in public. I know he was baptized when he was young  but I am worried that he is falling into sin and away from Jesus. What  should I do in this situation? "

If humans were created on the 6th or 7th day (I’m not quite sure which one it is please someone let me know) then when we’re dinosaurs around. Is it possible humans co existed with dinosaurs? Or did dinosaurs never exist, and if you believe this what about the fossile and things of that nature? It’s been something I’ve always wondered about and I can never find a clear answer? Does the bible say anything in particular about this? And do religious leaders have specific ideas about this? Thanks to anyone who answers and sorry if I offended anyone."

2859,"Hi all!

I could really use some insight on the subject. I’m praying I hear from God through your comments, so please take a moment to pray before you comment—thank you!!

I’m a single mom of a 1 1/2 year old & I just recently had to move back home. I work as much as I can & my mom & grandma help me with childcare as much as they can. I’m so grateful for them. 

I’m a baby in Christianity. I can’t tell you exact when I gave my life to Christ, but just know I’m still an infant. 

I’ve been doing my best & tithing 10% of all that I make, but I’m needing to take handouts. I kind of feel weird about it, I don’t know. I can’t get SNAP because my mom & grandma have too much of an income & in Ohio you need to put everyone in the household on the application. I have WIC but they just lowered the allowance for the foreseeable future, & it’s kind of stressing me out. 

I want to follow what God has put forth in the Bible, but I hardly make any money & the tithe is substancial to me. I know He’s pleased that I am being responsible with a little, & maybe one day He’ll entrust me with a lot. 

I’ve gotten different opinions about this from Christians I’ve asked. Are there any verses you all can reference that will shed a light on this? Thank you!"
2860,"The gospel of John is my favorite because of the christology. People who deny the trinity state that John is an unreliable gospel because he was written a long time after the Mark, Luke and Matthew.

2862,"That was spontaneous, when I read the bible, I was fascinated by the beauty of knowledge inside of it and even have a tendency to solve all biblical questions. It’s like I can put investigating biblical questions into one of my personal interest. I even feel a kind of excitation if I can seek all the answer about things in Christianity
In my church, the pastor think that I asked a lot of weird questions(I don’t even rmb what question I asked since it’s long time ago) and even think I’m a very imaginative person, almost no one knows what I’m thinking, my brain processing speed is faster than my mouth
Yeah, I can sometimes be very critical of what the preacher in my church said. Two years ago have lunch with her and she talked about how evolutionism contradicts to creationism, I was quite astonished and even wanted to argue with her but I can’t, because I’m not an expert of evolutionism
I also once heard a pastor tell me Earth formed before the Sun just because the bible said god created Earth on the 2nd day, then the Sun on the 4th day. He even tell me that I can pose a theory to explain Earth formed earlier than Sun. I was like: rather than asking about why Earth formed before the Sun, ask why bible only use two pages to talk about how god created the world"
2863,"So I have struggled with the sin of lust for the past 2 years but I have recently been able thru gods grace to beat temptation most of the time, what I am asking advice for however is. I recently have entered a relationship, we are both Christians and we’re trying to center our relationship on Christ, she makes me want to be a better person and I really want this to work out in the long run. But whenever say she grabs my arm or my hand or even when she says really sweet things I can’t just like simply enjoy it, I wish I could but even tho I am just living in the moment and am not fantasizing over her or thinking dirty thoughts I can’t stop my body from reacting in a certain way ( if you catch my drift) anyways I know it’s not bad to be attracted to my gf but we’re waiting for marriage definitely and this is my first relationship so I don’t know what to think I feel ashamed but I want to know what to do I know if I continue doing my best with resisting temptation that will help and I pray constantly but any advice would be greatly appreciated"
2865,"I’ve been struggling a lot the past couple months (24m). I have been drinking a lot more than normal, my anxiety is through the roof, and I just feel like crap most days. I started a new job while I’m finishing my masters degree and I just feel so tired and stressed and anxious all the time. I never feel ok or comfortable in my own skin. 

The doctor prescribed me medication, but I am scared to take them. I know it sounds childish but medication really scares me. I’m scared it will alter me or change me for the worse.
I’ve been praying for god to help me with this but it’s just silence. I am worried I will never feel better and he will not answer this prayer. 

The way I have been feeling has really been effecting my personal life. I have been taking a lot of my stress out on the people around me. My now (ex-girlfriend) decided to leave me yesterday. I really loved her but I understand why she left. It hurts me that I hurt her. 

I feel like my life is falling apart. Everything is crashing down around me. 

I don’t know what to do. I keep praying for help with my anxious thoughts but it’s just silence on the other end. I just want to feel ok. I want to feel like myself"

During this time I’ve been having severe insomnia which has been hindering my healing and recovery to the point to where I’m completely house bound now and my husband has become my care taker. I’ve tried a million things for the insomnia (especially natural) and the only thing that has worked is a prescription medication. The medication gives me terrible side effects which make it even harder to function. At this point I don’t know what to do anymore. I need a miracle from the Lord. I need to be delivered from the insomnia and medication, so so bad. I don’t know how I can keep going like this. I’m feeling so hopeless and scared. I just need Jesus to take it.

Just thinking of what I didn't get in my youth and how dark my future looks makes me frustrated, angry, and depressed. Even though I'm doing well financially and physically, there's still something that bothers me, and I think it's me wanting a family, wife, and kids! It's been hard for me to put myself in a position to get married because I'm not good with women, I don't know if I'm good enough and it's bringing my self-esteem down! Even though I've gone to church my whole life, I'm more lost now than I've ever been! I'm so confused that I question my faith and nobody understands me, not my parents or pastors. I don't have nothing and my mind is numb. I'm not connected to anyone at my church, and fellowship is bleek since it's a small church. Online Christians aren't very friendly, and I'm not good enough for women. I feel confused, angry, and depressed! It's a bunch of self-pity, but this is how I actually feel! Help, advice, or some kind of fellowship would be great! Thank you to anyone who helpe"

2869,"‭Romans‬ ‭14:12‬ ‭
So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God.

I sometimes find myself concerned with wondering what other Christians think I should do, so that I will stay on the proper track with the Lord, the narrow road.  Some brothers and sisters are very quick to answer and tell me what is right and wrong, and I appreciate them giving me exactly what I ask for.  Normally it is in the form of directing me to Scripture, which is even better.

Others are quiet, and their silence feels like they are pointing a direct finger to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for me to find my answer by going straight to the Source.  It is also greatly appreciated as it is a reminder that it is not what others think, it is what He thinks.  It quickly directs me to prayer.

Both of these things lead to answers, and I say this to open minds to both avenues.  I trust the Lord to direct me to the appropriate answers whichever the avenue, as we serve One God, who when we are earnest in our requests, will speak answers to us in many ways.  We just have to listen.

In the end, we will all stand before Him.  Before I make a decision that really presses on me, I ask myself, ""how will you feel about answering to this, in front of the Lord?"" My answer comes to me quickly."
2870,Could someone help me understand these fringe ideas?
2871,"Prayer based on Romans 4:9-12

Abraham was declared righteous before he was circumcised.

Father, thank You for blessing Paul and giving him the strength to stand against opposition and boldly proclaim Your truth.
The Jews believe that Abraham was a paragon of virtue, but Paul declared that he was a sinner saved by grace. God accepted Abraham as righteous, not because of anything he had done but because he believed in His promise. Paul asks, is the blessedness that David spoke of in (Psalm 32) only for the circumcised Jew, or is it also for the uncircumcised Gentile? Paul tells us that Abraham was not made righteous by circumcision, for he was declared righteous before circumcision existed. (Genesis 15:6) Paul tells us that circumcision is an outward sign of the promise given to Abraham. (Genesis 17:11) Abraham was declared (counted) righteous because he believed in God. Paul says that Abraham was the father of all who would believe in the promise, not only the circumcised Jews but also the uncircumcised Gentiles. All those who walk in the faith that Abraham had before he was circumcised are the true descendants of Abraham.
Father, we need the faith that You freely gave to Abraham so that we may also walk in Your ways. May we know the joy that only comes when we listen to You and strive to do Your will. Let us look confidently to You for the guidance and strength we need to live a life that gives You all the Glory, Honor, and Praise, You rightfully deserve. Amen.
Questions for reflection and meditation:
1.	Why was Abraham declared righteous?
2.	Do you see a saint as a paragon of virtue or as a sinner saved and kept by grace?
3.	How is it possible to experience the blessedness that David speaks of in Psalm 32?
4.	When have you cried out to the Lord to teach you to pray, delight in His Word, give you more joy, wisdom, guidance, etc.?"

Was checking out this little debate between Kelly and Sean, if you know Kelly powers than you know trinitarianism is his wheelhouse.  

Sean asked the question **do you believe the Holy Spirit has a body?**

Now The conversation gets interesting as these debates tend to get when it comes to the trinity @ 1:48:00.  

**I am also aware** that people consider Sean to be a heretic for his teachings, So just be warned you might hear some things that may trigger you, Kelly also is no doormat so he makes things interesting in his apologetics techniques.   

Anyway I thought you might find the conversation interesting to say the least at 1:48:00."
2881,"I am a new Christian and I have been attending the church that agreed to baptize me, but most of the sermons are all about planting new churches. I live in a smaller community where there are a ton of churches. The last 3-4 times I went they reference small bits of scripture and then discuss tithes and how they are going to expand in the community. As a new Christian (everyone knows it's very overwhelming at the start) and I go because I hope they will read scripture and dive deep into it and discuss it. Today I left in the middle because my heart said to leave, it was doing nothing for me ob my journey to understand and apply gods word into my life. I'm not judging them, just following my heart. Am I being to harsh, or should I attempt to find a church that focuses on scripture and teaching us how to be a better biblical Christian?

Thank you all & God bless"
2882,"Hello, any fellow Christians have any tips for somone struggling with porn? I fell like I've strayed so far. I was was raised in the church and still go to service. Not as often as I should but I try. I wanna get back with my Lord and Savior and kick this habit. Thank you."
2883,"I genuinely do not know what to do. I am a 22 year old Female, my partner (23 Male) cannot seem to let go of my past sexual relationships. I have been with him for about 5 months, before making me his girlfriend, he knew I had slept with multiple different men when I was 19-21 yrs. During this point in my life, I didn’t have a stable relationship with Christ. Since this time, I have established a relationship with God, been baptized, and I have completely changed my morals and values. I have gone through shame and guilt for giving myself to that many men, I have held myself accountable before God and through Him I have been forgiven. I did not want to live in such sin anymore, therefore about 3 months into dating my current boyfriend I told him I want to stop having sex and wait for marriage. He is a Christian too, he agreed, we moved forward. 

The past few weeks have been rocky to say the least. He has been brining up my past saying that I should feel shame and guilt still for sleeping with multiple men in my past. I have repeatedly explained to him that I have already gone through that shame and Jesus has forgiven me so I need to forgive myself. Despite this, after a few to many drinks he has called me a whore, says I’m not a child of God, says I cannot live in purity because of my past, etc. 

Hearing these things from him is heart breaking. It makes me question who I am. I know I am a child of God, that I am forgiven , and that I can live a life of purity. But the things he says to me makes me question not only myself, but if I should be with him. I love him but if he cannot move forward from my past, than neither can I with this relationship. He says that since him and I want to get married in our future and since we have been living together that we are essentially married under the terms of the bible. But I do not believe that. Marriage is a covenant and we have not shared a wedding naming us husband and wife under Gods name. 

Regardless of this, if a partner in any situation feels sex is not right until marriage I think it should be respected. I also have a past of sexual assault that triggered the events of me having many partners. 

Before dating, he was well aware of my past and my experience with being SA. I’ve slipped up and have had sex with with him and after told him that although sharing that with him is special to me I want to work to resist that temptation moving forward. He goes on to say that having sex with me made him actually feel loved and cared for, which also really hurt me because I feel I show him that in many other ways.

I know I sound all of the place and this wasn’t really that well written but I just do not know what to do or How to help him understand my point of view, I love this man so much but he has made me feel so awful about my past and I do not think he shares the same values , morals, or understanding of Gods forgiveness as I do.

Edit: I was praying today and felt the Holy Spirit say to me, “if you are comfortable staying with him, then you are comfortable living in sin”. That really made me think more deeply into leaving him. I do feel comfortable with him, but I do not want to become comfortable in the sin he may be leading me to.

Another edit lol: I also have felt that I shouldn’t have moved in with him. I am learning and realizing that I should have waited to do that for marriage as well. I wish I had a reset button. I would have told him from the get go that I don’t want sex until marriage and same with living together. But that’s in retrospect, all I can do is move forward to live in this way now that I am realizing ways in my life I need to alter in order to strengthen my relationship with God and keep my heart pure."
2884,"Me and my boyfruend have been delving in a bit if teasing/a bit more 19+ conversations and any time it happens I just hear someone screaming how I'm a sl*t for this...

I'm so scared"
2885,"I am a pentacostal Christian, raised in a Christian family, and I am slightly more progressive than they are, but not too drastically. Recently (well like 5 months ago), I found out that I had a crush on this boy at my school (I'll call him N). 
I think this is bad, because this boy draws my thoughts away from God, but also to Him. The former because I spend so much time with him on my mind, but the latter because the boy is a strong atheist, and I want to convert him.
However, the feeling simply won't go away, and bringing him to Christ isn't something I think I can do alone, and confronting him directly is almost unimaginable. 

Any advice? Prayers would be appreciated too!"
2886,"I dont want to be legalistic i enjoy nicotine but have heard many say it is sinful. Will god have mercy on me? Am I saved?

Edit so its not a sin? I just wanna fuck somebody up and nicotine helps me have a way to decrease stress/ a way to vent"
2887,"I come from a Christian background, and have even considered myself a believer from time to time. I’ve never really had an issue with believing the miracles, like the resurrection, unlike many atheists do. At the very least, I don’t consider them impossible. But somehow, this is not enough for me, and I find it hard to believe in (or trust) the goodness of God, and the divinity of Jesus, etc. My thought process is basically that what difference does it make if Jesus was resurrected, given this world is still such an awful place? I also have doubts regarding whether the “moral system” of Christianity is even that great. This is primarily due to my exposure to eastern religions, e.g. Buddhism. For example, how come God or the early Christians never disapproved of slavery? I don’t buy the argument of slavery just being reflective of “the times”, since Buddhism is also very old and still disapproves of any trade in living beings. I also resonate with the avoidance of alcohol, meat, etc. I don’t like all parts of Buddhism either, but to some degree, it seems more advanced (for lack of a better term). Finally, at times I feel very distant from the God in the Bible. It’s like he is not approachable. I’m not sure he is looking “for me”. I guess part of that is even explained in the Bible, as in only a few are chosen, but it’s still depressing and makes it harder to believe.

How do you deal with questions and thoughts like these?"

2889,"I am a young adult and definitely have so much to learn, but I have been a Catholic my whole and recently started taking things a bit more serious. In turn, I have been reading more and talking to some priests about the faith. 

One thing I could never really grasp is how/why the Church is structured the way it is. More specifically, some of the seven sacraments ceremonies and the main way of learning about the faith is through Mass.

I’ve found that learning about Christ and interpreting the scriptures myself has brought me closer to him than the Church. So long as I’m not preaching my thoughts as law to others and doing it from a place of love, is there really anything wrong with that? 

Due to the history of Churches(ex. How members of the Church used to take advantage of the poor such as abusing their “powers” of excommunication), I have always had qualms with how things are set up/why we should take the Pope, bishops, and priests words as law because of human error.

I don’t want this post to be so long and make this sound like a rant but rather an inquiry. God bless!"
2890,"Hello everyone sorry if the way i text is not correct this is not my native language, so i would like know is someone here can help me, for a long time i believed God and jesus are different person i grew up in different religion but today i wanna believe and understand really the bible, i suffer ocd religious because in the last religion they made me feel that exist a God so strict i didnt met a God lovely like i listened before, my ocd is about unforgiven sin and yes even if a read the pasage i didnt understand like i would like to, i wanna learn about jesus about really the story is someone can help me understand my questions i will appreciate thanks a lot."
2891,"I've read lots of stories of people who were in a bad situation, saying that they met a person (either homeless, or old people, or young people) and later, they were convinced it was an angel in human form. There was something odd about them. They had beautiful white teeth, their face was like glowing, clear, even it they were old, they looked oddly young. When these people looked at them, they suddenly felt peace. They didn't talk much, but they always helped. When they went their separate ways, the people looked back after a few seconds, but there was no one there. It's like they disappeared. 

Have you or your relatives experienced something like that?"

I haven't been baptised and I don't know how any of that works and i'm scared i'm doing something wrong or i'm not doing the right thing (like praying wrong or something). I just don't know where to begin with being Christian and I need advice on what to do. I'm also confused about like different types of Christianity e.g Catholic or Orthodox etc.
2896,"I screwed up big time. I’ve been a Christian since I was a kid, and have always deeply loved God. Then in early college, I was raped. After that, I swore I would do better and would not sin against God again. I met my boyfriend, and we began sinning sexually, which caused our relationship to end because of how guilty I felt. Now that I’m single, I downloaded tinder just to meet people. And I have fallen into a pit. So many men just seem to want sex. And I am here, and I feel like a weak, pathetic whore who can’t say no half the time. I deleted the app after a week. But I still feel like I’ve gone too far now. I’m worried God won’t take me back because I will probably do this same thing again. I am just so ashamed in myself, and honestly loathe what I have become.

I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. I just needed to share with someone."
2897,Do all Catholics believe in infernalism? Or can they believe in annihiliationism too? And what happens if someone dies before he can repent for his sins? Of if he doesn’t understand why a sin is a mortal sin? Or if he doesn’t interpret the scriptures in a certain way that makes him unsure if something is a sin or not?
2898,"*(from oca.org)*

Saint [Theodore](https://images.oca.org/icons/lg/october/1002admiraltheodoreushakov.jpg), one of Russia’s greatest naval heroes of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, was born in 1745.

The unvanquished Admiral was the terror of his country’s enemies, and the deliverer of those whom the barbarians had taken captive. He served during the Russo-Turkish War (1787—1791), and also fought against the French. Although he fought many naval battles in the Black Sea and in the Mediterranean, he never lost a single one, and he was never wounded.

Saint Theodore once visited the Greek island of Kerkyra (Corfu), where he venerated the relics of Saint Spyridon of Tremithus (December 12), and gave support and encouragement to the Orthodox Christians in that place.

Since his naval reforms were unpopular with his superiors, Saint Theodore was forced to retire in 1807 by Tsar Alexander I. Having neither wife nor children, the admiral settled in the town of Alekseevo near the Sanaxar Monastery, where he regularly attended services on Sundays and Feast Days. During Great Lent he would stay in the monastery, fasting with the monks and attending the services.

Igumen Nathaniel of Sanaxar regarded Saint Theodore as “a neighbor and a significant patron” of the monastery. In addition to his generous gifts to the monastery, the admiral frequently gave alms to the poor and needy. He never sought earthly glory or riches, but spent his life in serving God and his neighbor.

Saint Theodore died in 1817 at the age of seventy-two. After navigating the sea of life with all its storms and struggles, he entered the calm harbor of eternal rest. He was buried at Sanaxar Monastery beside the church. The monastery was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1991, and Saint Theodore’s grave was found in 1994.

Saint Theodore was glorified by the Orthodox Church of Russia in 2004, and a reliquary in the shape of a naval vessel was made to enshrine his holy relics.

The holy Admiral Theodore should not be confused with his relative Saint Theodore (Ushakov) of Sanaxar Monastery (February 19 and April 21), a monastic saint who lived from 1719 to 1791.

Saint Theodore is honored as a great military leader who defended Russia just as Saint Alexander Nevsky (November 23) and Saint Demetrius of the Don (May 19) did before him. One of the Russian Navy’s atomic cruisers has been named for him, and a movie has been made about his life and career. The composer Khachaturian has also written a musical piece called “Admiral Ushakov.”

2900,"So... um, me and a freind got into a somewhat pointless argument about weather of not poop jokes are sinful... I have no idea how it started, but it did. We discussed it back and fourth and couldn't come up with an answer. Sorry for asking this, I'll never speak of it again😣😣

2901,"Recently I (pretty much agnostic) have been led down a path to do a course in counselling but it is ""christian"" counselling, since all the other courses are way too far away.

I asked God for a sign a while back, then my cat died, was this Gods rage? Or was it ineffitable or a lesson? Maybe ineffitable and God didn't cause it. Since I did end up saving 2 kittens.

Anyway now I have been led back towards Christianity and God. Which I think is more than just a coincidence.

But at the same time I watched Vikings Valhala weeks back around that time after she died and it has the history how Christians wiped out all the nordic pagans because they hated paganism. Anyway there were very poignant scenes with the male seer. Relevance is that is my ancestors.

I felt like I predicted my female cats death because I was super anxious about her and my other cats that died (as a child) and trying to get permission for a cat enclosure (bfs dad said no).
I think I have some sort of seer like ""power"" because I will get all anxious and depressed before something bad happens, like I can sense it. Or have a poignant thought or image.
Like how my bfs friends baby was stillborn and the night before I was watching a show on netflix with a stillborn and I really pondered it and it was very potent in my mind, like it meant something more and was a message.
Way more examples of this.

Anyway is it possible to be a Christian but also a seer? I'm not sure if I believe in pagan Gods because theres so many and its so complicated. I think someone or something is guiding me but also that I have some sort of seer like gift/curse? Lol"
2902,"I was raised in a Christian household and I went to church as a child but I was always bullied and pushed away by the other kids in Sunday school. A lot happened and my family stopped going to church.
We started going again when I was about 15 or 16 years old and I went with a friend of mine from school to a teen worship program the church offered. Her and I were bullied and pushed away from everyone else so I stopped going to church altogether.
I'm almost 19 now and I want to have a stronger relationship with God but I don't want to go to church because I have this fear that I'll be judged or pushed away again.
Is it a sin not to go? Is it possible to worship from home? I don't know what to do."
2903,"The best time for me to go through the bible is while I'm at work as I can listen to the audiobook of the KJV somewhat uninterrupted. Unfortunately, every few verses I'll either end up needing to replay it or Google some questions I have.
Was just wondering if any Christian youtuber (or from any other platform) has a series that goes through the bible and explains it."
2904,"When I make mention of Jesus Christ, praying or anything of the faith, depending on the company, it is either met with joy (from the faithful), eagerness (from the willing), no interest, resistance or hatefulness.  I am careful to not verbally share the Gospel more than once to those not interested, resistant or hateful on the matter.

Shower everyone with the love of Christ and those unwilling to hear with their ears will see with their hearts.  Pursuing arguments or debating those that are not even remotely eager or willing to listen has not proved fruitful to me.  I'm not advising against it, I'm just sharing my experience.  I don't give up on anyone, but Bible thumping to the unwilling pushes people farther from the Truth in my experience.

Arguing also invites hate, doubt and offense into our hearts, at least it has for me.  Those things can take time to shake off, especially if you don't recognize them and forget to jump into prayer immediately to remedy and cleanse yourself, all to His Glory.

One of the most beautiful things is seeing someone willing and eager to hear about our Lord and Savior.  When the Holy Spirit puts you in these situations, pursue and do not brush it off.  Make time, and realize the evil one will try, in those moments, to pull you away.  Fight off those temptations, and share the Gospel.  Saying a brief prayer in your mind, and making the sign of the cross, have helped me immensely.

Many times, I feel like I don't know what to say when the opportunity to share the Gospel presents itself.  Ask the Holy Spirit to be your tongue in the name of Jesus Christ, to Glorify the Father by planting seeds for the Kingdom, and just speak to the person.  Trust Him to do the work through you.  Provide the person with a Bible or point them to the free Bible app on the app store, and make yourself a resource to them.  

Ask if they would like to give their life to the Lord and walk them through it, if they are not interested yet, let them know you are happy to help them should they decide.  It is easy for me to give advice, but I would be lying if I told you I put this into perfect practice.  I have had lost opportunities from my own cowardice, and I have seen great success, all to His Glory.  Ask Him for mercy and forgiveness for lost opportunities, ask Him for more opportunities and strength, and keep humbly serving the Lord with joy."

Jesus is kind and loving, Jesus is gracious and forgiving. I love Him so much. He is my beautiful Lord and God, and I love Him so much. He is beyond wonderful to me.

I cherish Him, He is so beautiful and I love Him. I adore Him, Jesus is the reason I live. Jesus is my one true delight. Jesus is my everything. Jesus is so precious to me, Jesus is wonderful.

2910,"Hello to all,

I feel completely lost. Years ago, I accepted Christ. I turned from Islam to Christ and felt great.  
Then, I always had on and off periods, where I turned away from Christ, fell into old habits such as porn, bad behavior etc. and not believing in the holy spirit and Jesus. I even had periods, where I turned away from Christ completely.

I really want to get back into accepting Christ and accepting our Lord and Savior. 

But I am worried that I am too far away from being saved. I also have never been baptized. 

I always have the same patterns - getting back to Christ, and when bad things happen, I fall back into old hedonistic habits.

Can I still be saved and is there redemption for me ?

2919,"To preface:

I am a female 

I don't watch/like porn 

I have never actually acted on my temptations

I don't have sexual fantasies about people (that's gross)

I have tried praying for years 

I am baptized

I've tried to stop it via punishment. >!Such as cutting or strangling myself if I have crushes!<  Didn't work. Skinner lied lol. Positive punishment doesn't always work 

I've tried not thinking about it

I've tried to make myself like guys and am still trying to make myself feel something for them. It's like, in rare instances, I can admit a guy is good looking but I feel dead inside around them. I don't feel anything. There is no emotion. Just indifference. With females, I get butterflies and I blush and I feel giddy. 

I was VERY sheltered from homosexuality as a kid and didn't know it was a thing until half way through middle school. My first crush was in 4th grade. 

I do consume media with gay characters. I tried to stop and consume exclusively straight things. Like only hetero movies, TV shows, and books. It kinda worked but not really. It didn't make me straight but it took away my interest in relationships. It was one of those numb things. It didn't make me want a boyfriend but it helped take my mind off wanting a gf. But as soon as I see a lesbian couple, I get that feeling of longing again. It doesnt go away, it jusf becomes easier to supress. I wouldn't say consuming gay media MADE me gay (since the signs were there before i knew what gay was) but it makes me more aware of what I can't have. I only watch and read it because I live through it. I know I can't be in a relationship but at least I have an outlet. Idk. I should probably stop. 

And no, I don't have trauma. Just autism.

What else can I try? How did it go away for you?"
2920,"I practiced sin deliberately. I deliberately rebelled against GOD. I stumbled with Hebrews 6:4-6 and Hebrews 10:26. I got scared that I would never be forgiven. I repented and GOD forgave me.

Brothers and sisters. When you sin NEVER EVER RUN FROM GOD. When you sin, repent and ask GODs forgiveness. GOD will forgive everyone who repents

1John 1:9: ""If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.""

Be blessed.

PS. After you recover, read Bible and pray consistently. If your sin is related to addiction, cut every temptation. If you are alcoholic, drug user, don't walk around your addicted friends, dealers, stores, bars etc. If you are addicted to porn, masturbating, porn comic idc. Any kind of lust is sinful. Delete your socials and block google or any browsers. Personally these advices didn't work much for me. You gotta want from within to repent. Just abstain from temptation ok? And read your Bible and pray. Bye"
2921,"... then there's no problem at all. No contradiction. And don't believe anyone telling you it's a sin. It is not a sin, never has been and never will be. That's a fact. That's in the text.

*TDLR : being homosexual or LGBT doesn't even appear in the Bible. Conservative Christians are using anachronic concepts to justify their hate. They are literally opposed to God and Jesus' message.*

The Bible literally doesn't talk about you. Some hateful so-called Christians here love to quote the few verses calling out homosexual practices, but these have nothing to do with being LGBT. 

The word ""homosexual"" to characterise people or identity is extremely recent (19th century). The Bible talks about *sexual practices* linked with *sexual immorality*. God warns us of predatory practices, among which sodomy, especially between young and older people (it is even quite literal , check the Hebrew text of Leviticus!), as it was the case in Ancient Greece at the time. 

Therefore, God never talks about being LGBT and having consensual relationships with people you love and want to found families with. He talks about being wary of predatory and immoral sexual practices, such as incest (in the same chapter in Leviticus where are mentioned ""homosexual"" practices). These are the abominations. Loving another person of the same gender never has been and never will be. 

The Bible doesn't talk about LGBT people and all the ones who pretend otherwise are lying or ignorant. 

*You are not an abomination for loving who you love. Sexual violence and predatory practices are abominations. It has nothing to do with you if you respect your partner. Nothing. God bless you.*

What is a sin is judging people, disrespecting people, using God's name in order to justify disgusting beliefs. These are sins. These so-called ""Christians"" are new Pharisees, judging the world in the place of God, and not understanding a word of what they're even saying. 

*As Christians, we have to take care of people who are hated for no reason. It includes LGBT people. They should always be welcome in any church. * 

And if you don't like it, nobody cares. I know what God stands for."

2924,"Hi all I’m here today to ask for some help and advice.

Currently I am in the midst of the final couple weeks of my final academic year. Of course along with this comes exams and great challenges. 

I have been trying to resist the sin of lust by controlling urges and such. The issue is when I do resist this sin and abstain, I struggle very much to study.

Flashback three months ago when we had mock exams, I gave into the sin, but still honoured God and did incredibly well , thanks to the Lord.

I truly do not want to sin and believe that the Lord will care for me but tbh I hold a bit of scepticism and doubt that this will be true. I’m scared that in order to do well I have to resort to my old sinful ways. Can anyone provide any verses or experiences to help??

Much love ❤️"
2925,"Hi, so f (22) growing up I kinda went to church a lot with my grandpa and with my aunt. I never really minded it honestly then going into middle school I would go to Wednesday service to mostly socialize but I really did enjoy the sermon part of it by the time I hit high school my relationship with God was none existent and I was also just not really having the faith and belief just questioning God a lot and not following his path. Saying “he’s not real” “he’s fake” literally thinking Christians are crazy and my family wholeheartedly agrees even to this day not a part of them believes I think my dad does but he doesn’t practice it at all 
About 2months ago I started getting into the word of God I always hate to say it cause I went to God at my lowest moment but that’s what happen I did and he uplifted me and kinda since then I’ve been living in Gods truth on his path 
I do 30min bible studies each morning I go to church on Wednesday and Sundays I absolutely love it and God but I just don’t want to start any conflict or drama with my family. I guess what I’m asking is it okay to worship God in secret, I would never deny if asked but would it be so bad ?"

I can't even play a video game because then I'll get that urge to stop because it's wrong. I can watch the TV for the entire day but as soon as I turn on the Xbox, I should stop? Like, what? I'm trying to kill the time. Wouldn't the TV be the idol in this situation?

Tomorrow I'm going to go to a library to ask because I've had experience as an intern, but if I am not able to, I'm going to lose my mind. God said that I am worse than an unbeliever because I don't provide but bro, I've been trying to LOOK for one! YOU can literally change that in a second, why are mad at me? I could give a rat's ass about my health but because of my kidney transplant, I HAVE to take care of it and I HAVE to afford it. Not to mention, I want to provide for the needy too. I want to help people, I want to care for them.

(I'm not implying that I don't take care of the kidney. I am grateful but I'm just saying that if it weren't for the kidney transplant, I would have provided for my family instead of myself)"
2928,Just masterbated. I don’t want to do it anymore .
2929,"I need some Christian podcast reccomendations! I am a 30 year old mum from Australia, so something relatable would be great too. I’m looking for modern, conversation style, questions and answers, Bible discussions etc. Thank you :)"
2930,"Why are there some souls that for example love weed and the feeling it gives you, while others get anxiety and hate it? Why do some have naturally addictive perspnalities while others possess great amounts of self control, me for example am always looking for a way to feel different, whether it be energy drinks, cbd, weed, nicotine, coffee etc. While others are perfectly content being sober"
2931,"Lamentations 3:22-23

I wish all a wonderful week full of love, kindness, opportunities and happiness."
2932,What do you think of Daniel Lazares 'false testament: archaeology refutes the bibles claim to history' article in Harpers magazine 2002 - the article is to be found on the Internet.

2933,"More and more Christians are opting to read the Bible at home instead of going to church. This trend is catching on and creating a new way of practicing faith. These individuals firmly believe that faith is not confined to church alone; it's a lifestyle that can be incorporated into everyday life.

While I still hold great respect for traditional church and its rituals, I personally find that reading the Bible at home gives me more freedom and flexibility to deepen my faith at my own pace. I've also connected with fellow Christians who read the Bible at home, and we've formed small Bible study groups to share our insights and understanding.

What are your thoughts on this?"
2934,"A evil king wants to kill a male new born 

A mother or (in this case a father) lets his son go down a river or come down from the heavens to be given to a Mother 

I said kinda so there’s a time gap 

The Son gets older and preforms miracles to convince the priests of Egypt and Pharaoh (or in the story of JESUS  Pharisees and Sadducees   )
To let GODS People go ( or in the case of JESUS he is the freedom )


Death of Moses,
I am pretty sure that the death of Moses marked the last person to die over the age of 40 or something like that. So through his death the people of Israel got to cross to the promise land .


Also why is it a common theme that the son dies first with Abraham and it is finished with JESUS"
2935,"Hi english is not my 1st language so sorry for all my gramma mistakes and others, as you can see from thw tittle getting a tattoo was on my mind lately. I know getting a tattoo is a sin but what about Christian tattoos? I wanted a Jesus Christ with cross on my back something like Hanayama had in Baki maybe someone watched this show. So what du you think of it, whats your opinion on it?"
2936,Why wasnt there  any archaeological proof for King Solomons reign found? F. e. his palace.

2938,"At my old Christian church (very small church in a very small town) when I was little, I had a pastor that would ask me every Sunday if and when I was ready to get babtized. Im sure he meant that lightheartedly, but he would always ask me constantly when I was going to get baptized. To my knowledge, you get baptized when you feel ready and fully accept Christ into your life. I was 12 and after being pressured so much I felt like it was finally time so I would stop being asked. Looking back, it hurts my heart because I feel like I didn’t make the decision fully on my own when I wanted to do it. Do I regret getting baptized? Not at all, I’m so happy I did and I fully believe Christ is the son of god. It was the best decision I ever made, it was just one that was pressured onto me at the time. So the question stands, am I still saved even though I was just pressured into it at the time? Or should I get re-baptized to be sure?"
2939,Do you think that prayer should be put back in schools?
2940,"Matthew 18:1-5, 10

In that hour came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven? 2 And he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them, 3 and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. 4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me:  10 See that ye despise not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father who is in heaven.

\[Commentary\]

Luke tells us in chapter 9 verse 46, that the disciples had been arguing among themselves as to which one of them would be the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.  They seemed to pause their bickering once they entered the house. Whether through natural discernment and the disciples’ inability to hide their ambition, or Jesus’s divine omniscience, He knew what they were thinking in His heart.  Jesus pulls a little child and sets him by his side.  The disciples were acting childish, so what better way to both chastise and teach than to use a child as an example.

Jesus frequently used the analogy of the necessity of becoming as innocent as a child, as a prerequisite for eternal life.  Indeed in John chapter three he told Nicodemus that one had to be as born again.  An implication that one had to repent of his past sins and metaphorically become as innocent as a new born child.

Jesus said, “***Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.   Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.***”

The Pharisees—the religious leaders of that era—were almost always acting in a pretentious manner, striving to portray themselves as better than anyone else due to their showy religiosity.  But Jesus said that you had to be un-pretentious, displaying no outward signs of an attitude of superiority.  What a contrast, the humility of a child versus the ostentatious, often hypocritical, airs of the Pharisees.  

Finally in verse ten, Jesus tells everyone not to despise or hate one of those who had learned the secret of humility, who had learned to be child like.  He said that their angels were always near God the Father.   What a concept! It gives us all something to strive for doesn’t it?"
2941,I know it’s because we have 2 new laws and stuff. But why? Why didn’t we just keep it?
2943,Jesus is God but he’s also the son of God how does this make sense?🤔
2944,"Today I returned to church after fighting my anxiety about covid. It felt so good to be among fellow believers!!  I think part of the reason I was wrestling with my faith is because I stayed away from church.  

People on here encouraged me to read the Word, and I started doing that.  Thank you all for that big of encouragement. 

Now I understand a bit of what Psalm 122 might have been saying."
2945,"When i was younger like 9-10 i got baptized at my church. But, i feel like I didn’t understand exactly what it meant. 
A few months ago (im 20) i had a strong urge to just read the bible and i was wondering, can i get baptized again… i really want to because I didn’t understand anything when n i was younger and ive  been sinning,  and repenting."
2946,"I went through quite much when I was young. About 5 years ago when I was 23 I found myself hating life, being suicidal and having no will to live. I was homeless, had been raped severally including relatives and no family to lean on. My parents are both alive but I didn’t want to burden them, I believe since I am an adult I should handle my own life. I tried suicide a few times but clearly was unsuccessful. I prayed and fasted many times and God listened to my prayers, things looked up and I started to feel like there was something to look forward to in life. I was in therapy, I found love and even though he was married he said he was making arrangements to get divorced 
Unfortunately now after 5 years I find myself somehow in worse mental condition, he left me, I hate myself even more now, I am more broke than I’ve ever been and I am performing so poorly in my job. I may be homeless again soon since I may not even afford my meals anymore. I don’t think I am attractive and don’t know if I’ll ever find love.
So I find myself having a hard time turning to God. Why finally take away good things from my life just when I thought life was getting better?"
2947,For instance not eating blood or not mixing fabrics
2948,"And what about people who use their wealth to help others by doing charitable deeds? And don’t you think there’s a difference between people who want money to escape dangerous financial circumstances, to take care of their family and help the poor vs people who get rich just to fulfill their own worldly desires and be greedy with it?"
2951,Life and marriage began falling apart so in turn I started to seek God and now feeling guilty
2952,"I’ve been doubting God’s existence for like… almost two years now. I miss the peace I had when I just… *knew* it. But now that’s gone. And it feels like it’s never going to come back. 

What proof do we even have? How do we know this isn’t just some man made story to ease off the fear of fading into non existence? How do we know our deceased loved ones are still here with us?"
2953,"I was told that it was an act of using the Lord's name in vain? The person who told me so was a Christian, and I had just started delving into Christianity so I don't know if what I did was truly a mistake. I've also been told that people with other religions could find it offensive? I don't understand why and how my belief could offend someone entirely unrelated to me, but as those that told me are my superiors I find myself coming here to ask for different opinions and perspectives."
